While it was acceptable as a textbook - a broad survey of E-commerce for academic use - it would not be worth the considerable cost for someone who did not need it for a course.

For an academic course, the book serves as a base by providing definitions and explanations for a broad range of topics.  In my course, the book was used to introduce a number of topics that were discussed in further detail during class discussions, and it was supplemented by case studies, videos, and articles with more depth.  A non-academic reader would not have those enrichment elements available, thus would likely find the book less useful.

The book does not explain how to do anything (set up an online store, write a blog article, configure analytics, etc.).  It is a decent text for someone looking for a broad view of e-commerce with emphasis on defining terms and covering the big picture.

More importantly this book regularly cites wikipedia as a source, and I caught at least two examples of incorrect information when discussing how companies fit certain profiles. In one example it states that Kit Kat is a Nestle brand when it is produced by Hershey's. It also uses companies as examples that have long since been bought out by other companies. While neither of these two items errodes the core idea of marketing, they were just easily spotted. It makes it difficult to trust the core information when something so simple as a little research could correct these errors.

For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.

On the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.

It's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.

Starts off with ""what is HTML"" and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on ""the best way to lay out a site using CSS"" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.

She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.

She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.

UI - at the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is ""Certified Associate,"" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.

With this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from ""Adobe Certified Instructors"", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.

For the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a ""test"" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.

When I got a chance to request these videos, I thought I'd get a chance to learn Dreamweaver, finally, to maximize its capabilities. And I was totally blown away.

The videos are superb. The female voiceover is pleasant and very straightforward; there's no attempt at humor and no attempt to replicate a classroom course. The program uses live action sequences to walk us through specific examples, step by step. I was amazed at how many Dreamweaver features I haven't used, just because I didn't even notice they were there.

I am not a web designer but I do know HTML and some CSS. If you don't, I'm not sure the opening video will be enough. It's not like Wordpress where you just dive in.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.

When I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.

As for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.

Personally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.

  What this is
  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process
  - A wonderfully designed interface
  - A great overview of using DW

What it isn't
  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)
  - An expert tips and tricks reference

All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.",A Fantastic Overview of Dream Weaver and Web Design in General,

I think some reviewers are confused about both Dreamweaver and this product - these aren't for ""design"". If you don't already know what you want to do, picking up Dreamweaver is not going to help!

I used a pure HTML editor, which for beginners is the best way to go. You'll learn HTML and CSS along with exactly how your code changes your page. DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, it's also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And that's where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in.

I had really hoped that this dvd video that is ""Adobe Approved"" would have helped, but it fell short. First off I do want to give kudos for the way the software interface is designed. They made it very easy to navigate and find specific contents and general ease. Candyce Mairs, the teacher, gives excellent explanations and speaks clearly and at a good pace. The pace isn't too fast or too slow and I never had to rewind to listen to instructions over and over.

The course begins with the absolute basics so this is where it really breaks everything down about Dreamweaver. Being I knew most of the basics, after an hour, skipped some of it because I already knew it. The first problem I have with this training video is that you are taught to design websites from 1990. The look of them is so out dated and old its a waste of time learning it this way because anyone wanting to design a web site would not want one that looks so out dated and blah. When the videos finally get around to showing the ""CSS"" style designing, they show an example of a web site that is current in design and style. Exactly what I was wanting to learn but they don't use it for the training...WHAT? are they joking? They go back to the 1990 styled site that they show you in the beginning of these videos and TRY to update and revamp it into CSS. I wanted to focus on the CSS portion because for my needs, this is the missing info that has held me back on finally learning and make a modern web site using Dreamweaver.

The sample that they should have used to teach the CSS had many bells and whistles like when you scroll thru the site the background didn't move. The background was a great illustration photo! Then there were great drop down sub nav links that all had different colors, maps, columns, video etc. Again, all the modern bells and whistles. Yes, they do teach many of these features but in the OLD 1990 style, not in the CSS which is a complete different way of putting things into the program. I really wish they used the sample which they showed about how great CSS is. TOTAL BUMMER!!!!

I have plenty of experience with web design, i'm no expert but have worked with many programs over the years as well as designed many custom sites that look modern.

I mostly learned by myself so it's good to learn things I wasn't aware of.

I find the instructors voice pleasant and thorough although I thought it took way too long to get down to business.  I didn't really feel like I was learning or doing anything until well into the lessons.  She also seemed to wander off course to much for my liking.

I also found that she didn't prep me well enough for each lesson by telling me what files I needed and setting up Dreamweaver for each lesson.  I was frequently going to the DVD's Assets folder to get files that were missing from the lessons.  Luckily I have been using Dreamweaver long enough to know how to troubleshoot and find the missing parts.  But I wonder if a beginner would get confused and not know what to do without careful lesson setup.

And I could swear there were a few mistakes on the lesson's end in the quiz answers at the end of each lesson.  Some questions were confusing.

All in all this is great way to learn visually.  Much better than a book in my opinion.  But I would ask for a good deal more attention in not leaving the student in the dark at times.",Pretty good but some shortcomings,2
4.0,False,"01 25, 2011",A3EZEP0FX5BC1P,0321719816,A Conrad,"This is my honest review of the Adobe Dreamweaver Learn by Video.  The DVD comes in a standard plastic disc holder in a cardboard box, which is part of the whole box package.  It DOES NOT come with Dreamweaver CS5.

I thought it was a standard video DVD.  It is in fact a program that has to be executed (without installing anything on your computer.)  I am running it on a PC workstation.  My antivirus/spyware programs have not gone off yet, so there does not seem to be any malware associated with it.

The video contains over 12 hours of video instruction, and is accompanied by a printed guide book to teach the fundamentals of Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.  It also goes through some basic principles and fundamentals of web design.  The presenter (Candyce Mairs) is a clear and eloquent speaker, and is an Adobe Certified Instructor.  The video runs in the middle of the window, and you can select to have the sidebar available or hidden.

First few chapters are very basic.  It is intended for those who have little or no background/experience with the terminology, such as ""URL"" and ""domain name.""  Yeah, it's goes to the fundamentals.  I like the subtitle at the bottom of the video.  The first few chapters are so basic that I actually started writing this review while I the video is running on the other monitor (I have a dual-monitor setup).  The first chapter is dedicated to HTML fundamentals and also acts as a refresher for those who have the experience.  The second chapter is an introduction to what Dreamweaver is and what it can do.  Chapter 3 is a ""Quick Start"" chapter that gets the user setup with putting together a homepage (basic starter layouts, building the homepage, creating header area, etc.).  There are some tests at the end of each chapter to help reinforce what you've learned.

What I liked:
-This is a book designed for beginners.  As such, the first few chapters will be mostly overview and fundamentals.
-The DVD comes with a guide book.  It helps with the video, and it can be brought around so you can read it without the video.
-The course layout is logical, and therefore it makes sense.  I've seen so many poorly designed guides that jump all over the place, and this video guide is not one of these.
-Having the a ""video"" of what the speaker is talking about really helps.  You can follow what the screen should look like.
-The caption at the bottom of the video.  This was such a major positive.  A+++

What I did not like:
-The startup was not as straightforward as I expected.  Again, no big deal, but I can see how this could be a problem for those who do not know how to enable autostart, or those whose antivirus prevents the startup of an .exe file.
-The DVD could have came with the trial version of Dreamweaver.  No big deal if you have a fast internet connection, but I know a few people who are stuck with a slow DSL speed.

In the end, you'll be familiar with the program's interface, and hopfully you will learn how to use the essential commands and tools to create and design websites.  It also identifies some areas that are typically and easily overlooked.

The book (printed guide) is glued onto the packaging with those sticky gel dots.  Though it can be separated from the box, it was not immediately obvious and I ended up carrying the entire package with me.  I wish the book was kept separated or maybe in a pocket.  No big deal.

Overall, it is a nice beginner's guide to becoming familiar with and using Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.  Highly recommended.",A very good video course to learn the basics of Dreamweaver,2

Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.

The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.

I'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.
At some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version. So I recommend it.",Great Video for a Difficult at Times Program,
1.0,False,"12 12, 2010",AH4NKNB6TYXRE,0321719816,Kevin Barrack,"Summary: EXTREMELY slow pace, awful stilted narration, redundant lessons and completely unprofessional page designs (imagine a mySpace page designed by a 13-year-old). HOWEVER, if you are a complete novice then this disc will teach you a lot. Just be prepared for a very very slow pace. If you've never designed a web page then this may get you started but it will probably leave you lost after a while, because although she spends a lot of time explaining things almost as elementary as how to use a mouse, she does not cover much of the most basic web design fundamentals you would get in a beginning course at a school. And you will only be shown extremely childish examples of actual visual design and layout of web pages. If you have designed a web page before, then there is probably 30 minutes of material at the end of the course that will be useful, and if you don't mind clawing your eyes out in frustration then you could take the time to watch some of the earlier lessons to learn about the Dreamweaver interface. However, as another reviewer noted, there is not detailed index, so you will spend a lot of time skipping through lessons to find the salient parts. There are many ""lessons"" where all she does is talk about what she is going to teach you in the next lesson, i.e. teaching you nothing.

I used to code basic HTML by hand, but never learned CSS, so I wanted to learn it with this tutorial. I expected that to be part of the lessons but obviously not the majority. I also got Dreamweaver a while ago but haven't used it in years. I was patient at first, but then after a few hours of the most basic interface issues being hounded upon over and over again, I started skipping through lessons. And the author doesn't just give detailed lessons on how to use the Dreamweaver interface; she also goes in-depth to describe how to use basic OS functionality. Add to that her awkward, stilted speech and nasal voice (I'm not trying to be mean, but it just isn't professional), and I was pulling my hair out, even when listening to the lessons that I was interested in.

Examples:

* The bottom 10px of so of the screen in the videos is cut off, so that sometimes the narrator is referring
  to something she's doing, but her cursor and what she's clicking on are not visible on the screen. In addition
  there is a LARGE ""video2brain"" watermark obscuring some of the vital controls in the bottom right corner of the
  screen, once again making it impossible to understand exactly what she is doing in the Dreamweaver interface.

* An entire lesson (3:30 min) spent explaining how to create a new folder on your hard drive and change it's name.

* Several minutes spent explaining how to open and close palettes and windows in Dreamweaver. (Not rocket science.)

* Way too much time spent explaining basic OS/Browser functionality: Save/Save As functions, untitled documents,
  naming HTML files, where page titles display on a browser window, how to bookmark sites in a browser and how
  browser tabs work. None of this begins to expain how to use Dreamweaver, let alone build a web page.

* The history of meta tags, featuring the quote ""It's a meta tag because it has HTML brackets and it says 'meta'.""

* An entire lesson (6.4) explaining how to select, copy and paste text -- elementary OS functionality. Really,
  noting to do with Dreamweaver here! I'm not exaggerating. That was the lesson.

* 5 minutes spent on making bold or italic text (not an exaggeration). Not via CSS either, just regular ""strong""
  and ""i"" tags, and using the clickable buttons [B] [I] to set them in Dreamweaver.

* Time spent explaining how those little triangles on drop-down menus indicate that they are a menu with choices
  that can be accessed. Didn't the first Mac television commercial in 1984 already cover that subject in-depth?
  Or was that the Minesweeper tutorial?

* Time wasted explaining how to select all text. Not something tricky about how to select text and not catch code
  characters by mistake, just valuable time spent explaining that you could hit control-A to select all.

* Six minutes and thirty seconds spent explaining what the different types of HTML links are. Not HOW to create them.
  Not anything about styling them, or using javascript with them, or anything fancy like that. More than SIX MINUTES
  explaining that you can have a basic hyperlink or an anchor link, perhaps talking about relative vs. absolute URL paths.

* An example of her slow, wordy manner of speech. She adds 20px margin to something. Rather than saying ""that will
  now add 20px around all sides of the object,"" instead she says it ""adds 20px to the right...the bottom...the left...
  and the top edges."" Now imagine that statement taking 10 seconds to utter.

* The booklet is glued inside the box that the DVD comes in, so it is very inconvenient to reference or read
  (bulky and inflexible).

This video was quite obviously not scripted. The narrator makes several flubs throughout and laughs about them. She CONSTANTLY repeats herself from one lesson to another, which wouldn't be so bad if it was just a reference to what she taught us in a former lesson, but she invariably re-teaches that lesson again, so that you are begging on your hands and knees to be taught something new, anything! If you want to see an example of the author's web design capacity, take a look at my screen capture added to the product photos, taken from this DVD, where she shows a picture of her personal website which apparently has templates available for download. It absolutely boggles the mind that this woman would be officially Certified by Adobe. And according to her bio on the product page, she is also a ""Certified Internet Webmaster."" Let's dial the Wayback Machine all the back to 1995 and learn about what kind of responsibility THAT entails.

Overall, I think you can get better training by either going on YouTube (free!

It is not a DVD that you just pop into a DVD player to sit back and watch passively on TV. In fact, this DVD is only playable on the computer, because it requires you to use the mouse to select many of its options.  It's interactive and allows you to go to any and section as needed. At the end of each chapter, there is a test that you can take to see how well you have been learning.

There are 17 chapters and each chapter is divided into various sections. In the Training Content screen, which is the home screen when you play the DVD, each chapter and section has its heading clearly spelled out, so that you know where to go when you are looking for a particular video. It's the sections that you can click to play; the chapters are just ""folder names"" for organization purposes. Each section can vary from less than 3 minutes to more than 13 minutes long, depending on the complexity of the topic discussed. You can pause the video at any time, and there is captioning at the bottom of the screen to enhance your learning experience. The sub-titling is also valuable for non-English learners to help them understand what was spoken.

If you are a beginner, the best way to learn this program is to start from chapter 1, section 1 and proceed in order to the last chaper, because this video starts with the basics and progresses to more and more complex topics.

Compared to classroom instruction, I prefer using this Learn by Video DVD because it is very well produced with the instructor speaking clearly and the contents well organized.

The video has 17 sections covering the key elements of CS5 which allow the user to learn how to create a local web site from scratch and uploading it to the server. Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.

Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.

The videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (""Fireworks"" for ""Firefox,"" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.

Since each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the ""Watch and work"" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.

New features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.

If you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice.

I should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.

POSITIVE:
* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.
*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.
* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.
* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.
* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.
* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.
* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.
* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.
* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.

NOT SO POSITIVE:
* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.
* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.
* There is no ""search"" function or ""index."" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.
* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)
* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a ""personal index"" these bookmarks have their limits.

On the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.

The video material, contained on a single DVD, does a good job of covering all the important aspects of Lightroom 3.  This video is in my opinion, for advanced beginners on up.  I say this because the material is covered more deeply than what a beginner in the field of digital photography might be comfortable with.  Also, it is assumed that the student has some knowledge of digital photographic concepts (white balance, exposure, RAW format, etc.).  These topics are discussed without much intro-type explanation for beginners.  For me this is a good thing, as I had a reasonably good background going in.

The only thing that I wasn't thrilled about, although it is no reason to drop a star, is the pace of the training.  I actually like a faster pace.  If something is too fast, I just play it over.  The slower pace of this video training wouldn't bother me at all if there were a fast forward button that allowed me to still comprehend what is being said.  The only way I could speed things up was to skip ahead in small increments and then go back if I went too far.

It's pretty complete in its coverage of Lightroom basics, and differences from Lightroom 2; the only real issue I have is with the pacing. And that's not a real complaint about the product; it's more of a personal preference.

What you get in the package is a slim volume of 100 pages, about half of which discuss Lightroom and photography in general terms; the remaining 50 pages are divided between notes on setting preferences in Lightroom and tables of keystroke shortcuts. Given that the booklet is glued into the packaging, it's not exactly a handy references. The bulk of the course, though, is on a disk that contains (as noted in the description) a full 10 hours of video lessons.

The lessons are divided up functionally in a manner that reflects Lightrooom's functional division- the first section is devoted to importing photos, followed by a section on the Library function. Each section is in turn divided into lessons covering one or two detailed areas. You can play all the sections and lessons in order, or pick and choose as you like. I began by playing straight through the first two sections (over two separate sessions) and picked up a lot of new and useful information about using Lightroom 3. Each lesson involves watching an expert carry out some function while narrating exactly what he's doing. The demonstrations and accompanying narration afre very clear, and made it easy for me to perform the same actions on my own. There's also a ""watch and work"" mode, in which you can shrink the video window down and try an example on your own in Lightroom, using supplied data files. Very nice.

What I particularly liked was the us of professional photographers, rather than trainers, to present the material. The result is a real-world approach, in which the instructor both demonstrates the full range of options for some piece (like importing) and then explains exactly how he uses this in his own workflow. What you get is not a theoretical exploration of how a piece of software could be used, but a real demonstration of how it's being used by someone working in the field. Of course, that can be a drawback, too; one particular photographer's idiosyncratic methods may not be best for you. But I think this program manages to avoid that, but presenting the full range of possible approaches before the instructor gives his personal preference.

The one problem I do have with the course is, I suppose, unavoidable in this sort of presentation, and that's that the videos are fixed in duration and what's covered. Going through everything is going to take you the full 10 hours, at a minimum. You may look ahead to one chapter for something you're specifically interested in, only to discover after watching it through that what you really need is in a different chapter. That's why I generally prefer a text and image based approach. For me, at least, reading is several times faster than listening. But as I say, that's just my personal preference.

Look over intro page ix of the accompanying book to get an over view if it's capabilities. Although it launches full screen, it can be reduced in size like any other on-screen window. Find the small handle at the lower right. You could of course shrink it down to the task bar, but it runs and looks great at both small and large sizes. What's more, you can pause the video at anytime, run you own copy of Lightroom and actually work through the same steps you are learning about. In fact, the image used on the DVD are also included on the DVD, so you could repeat the lessons with the identical images. (The video lessons are also on the DVD in .mp4 and .3gp format, so you may be able to work through some lessons on your iPhone/iPad or 3G cell phone while commuting.)

It will pay to pause the first lesson and explore the user interface of the DVD playback software. It's not as complicated as LR itself, but quirky enough to make starting off somewhat confusing. You'll want to explore the LR interface at some point too.

The Lightroom (LR) interface is designed around a good, flexible work flow, and the lessons generally follow that workflow. Of course, in actual use you can easily jump around the interface as you want, but seeing the software in an actual work flow is terrific. LR, like Photoshop, is a deep product, and watching it being used is actually far easier to do than trying to follow step-by-step instructions from a book.

The DVD comes with a small book which you can remove from the packaging; it's got those small sticky pads holding the back of the book to the box. Just lift off carefully. The first half of the book is entitled ""The Photograper's Eye"" by Michael Jordan (but not that Michael Jordan.) This seems like basic filler, and is not related to Lightroom at all. The last half is pretty good, although a lot of those ridiculously small screen shots are included. The material covered is duplicated in  Lesson 1.4 to 1.4.9 so you can at least see a much bigger image. There is also a handy keyboard shortcuts list. The book is also handy in case you want to change some of the settings without reloading the DVD.

I have a few quibbles. In general, this DVD is aimed at Lightroom beginners. But much of Lesson 1 (1.1 to 1.3.7) deals with ""What's New in LR3"" which is almost useless, and frankly confusing, for someone using LR3 the first time. (If you just upgraded from an earlier version, this might be more interesting.) Start up your own LR and jump to 1.4 to begin the process of customizing your setup. At 1.4 you get a really useful, well explained review of the many LR settings.

If you start with the 'Play All' option, as recommended, the interface takes you automatically from lesson to lesson, although there is no visual indication of which lesson and chapter number you are actually on. The titles are shown on the right hand sidebar (Chapter Videos) if you open it, but not the lesson numbers. You can use the dropdown at the top of the main dialog to see this, however. You can choose specific lessons from the opening main screen if desired. As you go, you can set bookmarks for sections you might like to revisit. All you bookmarks are available from one of the tabs at the top... a really nice feature!

If you truly are a Lightroom beginner, this DVD will get you up-and-running quickly. If you have used Photoshop, and Camera Raw (CR) in particular, you will quickly see how adjustments in LR are so similar to CR, with LR adding so much more in terms of automation, asset management etc. Quirky start-up aside, this is an easy 5 star rating!",Excellent way to learn Lightroom,

I have Lightroom 2.7 so I was intrigued for two reasons: 1) what is new in Lightroom 3 that I should upgrade and 2) could I still learn something about the version that I have with this video. I am happy to say it exceeded my expectations.

The lessons are good; I actually look forward to learning more about Lightroom. The lessons are always focused on the computer screen - not wasted on watching the instructor speak. First I went through some of the lessons to get an overview of the features - some I found were explained in a way that made me realize that I should have been using them. But I will really use this as a reference when I want to work on my photos with the Watch and Work.

Watch and Work is a really cool feature. If you click Watch and Work (in the lower right corner) the application shrinks down and is placed in the upper left corner sort of out of the way. I say sort of because it is always on top and on my screen I am not able to get Lightroom completely visible. I can't find a minimize button so I have to go back to standard mode and then minimize it. But it does work and is a quick way to get the video up while I am working. (It's probably time I get another monitor...) The DVD does come with samples but I have no problem following along using my own photos.

While the lessons themselves are great I did find a few quirks.

When you first put in the disc Windows 7 pops up suggesting to run Start.exe. Choosing that starts the video with an intro from the two authors but there is no mention how to use the program. Fortunately there is a Table of Content in the upper left corner which is how I actually go through this. It isn't terribly difficult to use the video but it would make for a smoother and less timely start if they went over the use of it. The booklet does explain a little but not completely which goes for the help screen as well.

There is no install for the DVD. DVDs are either watched once or used for installation. Since I will use this as a reference and it will be used over and over they should have included an install so that you will always have access to the video. You can copy the entire DVD to your hard drive and setup a shortcut but for a lot of users that isn't always easy to do.

Right away I found an annoying orange menu that pops up even if I slightly bump the mouse. All it has are options for Full Screen or an info sidebar. These options are also available in the lower right corner. At first I wasn't sure if it was part their screen shots or the application on my computer. I have not yet found any info that explains this or how to turn it off and I have no use for this menu - strictly annoying.

Another annoyance is when you close the application it goes through the list, or credits, of who put it together. Why? My experience as a developer is that no one cares who created it; if it's good people will use it. But we get to see them every single time.
Tip: although it is an added step after you click the close button, click again and you won't have to wait through the credits.

The package comes with a booklet but it doesn't offer much. Half of it explains photography and how to take certain shots. If you are using Lightroom chances are you probably have several photography books already. Another section briefly goes through each of the new features in 3. And there is a section that shows the specific settings for certain screens and another section on the shortcuts. The booklet is not an alternative to learning the application but may be a handy reference for some.

The begin where you left off doesn't work for me in fact it suggested something I used yesterday.

But I really do look forward to learning Lightroom with this video. It is far better than the free ones I have found online. And it even helps me with 2.7. Once installed on my hard drive it works great as a quick reference. I am still debating on upgrading Lightroom at least right away. But this video made several features really clear that I otherwise might not have used. And while it does have a hefty price tag my benefits are worth the expense.",I look forward to learning Lightroom with this,
5.0,False,"09 13, 2010",A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6,0321700945,Conrad J. Obregon,"Some people learn more by watching than by reading. I know that I first learned about how to use Lightroom in videos by the redoubtable Michael Reichmann and Jeff Schewe, but that was mostly because they were the first out with instructional material. Mostly those videos were images of talking heads with an occasional screen shot. ""Learn Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 by Video"" is an offering by two other great image processing authors, Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland.

The approach taken is fairly standard. After an introduction the videos go chapter by chapter through each of the Lightroom modules, and an examination of most of the buttons and sliders that, because of its easy interface, has made Lightroom popular with so many photographers.  Each section shows a screen shot where the viewer can follow the moves made by the authors to apply Lightroom functions, accompanied by the voice-over of one of the two authors. The chapters cover everything from bringing images into Lightroom to outputting them to web sites or slideshows. The level of instruction is fairly simple, but if you've never used the software, the instruction will get the average person processing pictures after several hours of watching. More experienced users won't learn anything new, but they are not the audience. Not every function is covered in all aspects, like my favorite test, whether the discussion of keywords covers the importation of a keyword list from another source into Lightroom. On the other hand, although this isn't covered, it clearly a subject for a more advanced user.

At the end of each chapter there is an examination. Unfortunately, if you get an answer wrong, you won't be told the correct answer, so you'll have to watch the lesson again. Maybe that's not unfortunate.

The video comes with a booklet where Aaland first presents some ideas about composition (perhaps added because the video, like most Lightroom books, doesn't tell you when a slider or button is appropriate; for that, I'd recommend ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vision-Voice-Refining-Your-Vision-in-Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-Voices-That-Matter/dp/0321670094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vision & Voice: Refining Your Vision in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (Voices That Matter)</a>"" by David duChemin). That's followed by a chapter about what's new in Lightroom 3. The disk also contains images that can be imported into Lightroom by the viewer to follow the same procedures as the authors in the lessons. I'd like to say that this allows one to follow along with the authors, but it was here that video presentation encountered a stumbling block. With a book you could keep the book in front of the computer and, if images were provided, the reader could follow along. To duplicate the experience there is a button in the lower right hand corner of the video screen, called ""Watch-and-Work"". If you click this, the video is reduced to about one-fourth of the screen. Unfortunately, when I tried to follow along with the video, the video image was often in the way and had to be moved around to gain access to the Lightroom sliders. Eventually I figured out that it was easier to pause the video and minimize the video screen and work in Lightroom. This doesn't take a computer guru to figure out, but given that the videos are aimed at tyros, it might have been useful to provide more detailed instructions in how to use the videos. Unfortunately there is just a very brief help screen, that, to make matters worse, refers to processing the picture in Dreamweaver! It might also have been useful to suggest to users that as soon as possible, they should import the images provided on the disk into Lightroom, as well as other instructions on how to best use the videos to learn.

I'm still a person who prefers books, being a geezer who didn't grow up with YouTube. I underline important ideas or read them twice, and even read them on a bus, without opening a laptop. To be fair, the video does allow for bookmarking (again undocumented), that accomplishes many of these functions and perhaps reading on the bus may not be the best way to learn about running a piece of software like Lightroom.

I'm impressed by the video technology, and even though there are a few bumpy spots, as an introduction to Lightroom, this will certainly teach the new user how to use the software.",A Little Bumpy but It Works,41

Easy to use, well-designed, and useful.

BUT... at a fairly basic ""this is Lightroom"" level.  So, if you're new to Lightroom, and a visual learner (as opposed to wanting to read everything in a book), this is an awesome resource.  It's kind of like having an experienced photographer friend sit down with you and a copy of LR3 for 10 hours and go over every feature, in a reasonable degree of depth, one feature at a time.  But you get to pause, rewind, and rewatch it whenever you want, add bookmarks to favorite parts you want to review later, etc.

You can also learn LR3 on your own; that's what I did.  I'd been using the program for over a year before getting this, so I didn't think I had much to learn.  While I wasn't sure how useful this would be, I was pleasantly surprised.  I use primarily the Library and Develop modules (all the time), and was hoping to learn more about the other three (Print, Web, and Slideshow).  I certainly did, and am comfortable with those now.  But I also learned some pretty useful things about the ones I use constantly (I haven't really used collections before, for instance, and that's going to be a huge time-saver).

The two photographers that guide you through lightroom introduce you to all of its features, but don't necessarily give too much creative input... they teach you what you CAN do, not what TO do.  For most people, this is fine.  But they're not there to refine and hone your creativity.  Just get you familiar with the program, which they do very well.

What I'm a little disappointed by is that I didn't get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-Adobe-Photoshop-CS5-by-Video-Core-Training-in-Visual-Communication-Learn-by-Video/dp/0321719808/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn Adobe Photoshop CS5 by Video: Core Training in Visual Communication (Learn by Video)</a>&nbsp;instead.  I don't know Photoshop nearly as well as I know Lightroom.  And while Lightroom isn't too hard to figure out without a guide, Photoshop is pretty much impossible.  And that particular video item, while the same price as this, has over twice as much video (21 hours instead of 10).  If you're trying to learn both programs, I'd probably recommend getting that instead, and figuring out LR3 on your own.

Oh, and it comes with a book.  The book is a little odd, as it doesn't really go along with the product.  Instead, it has three main sections:  The first, is basically a ""welcome to photography, here's what you need to know to capture nice images"" with basic photographic advice.  Part 2 is ""what's new in LR3"" (compared to previous versions; only newly added stuff is mentioned).  The third part is Lightroom preferences... basically, descriptions of everything that you can tweak ""under the hood"".

The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.

There are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.

The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the ""Classroom in a Book"" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.

One thing I got here more clearly than in the ""Classroom in a Book"" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an ""object based"" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).

Overall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on ""Best Practices"" serves as a useful complement to the ""how to"" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the ""Next Video"" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the ""Next Video"" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. ""Hawaiin"" instead of ""Hawaiian""), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the ""inverseKinematics_start.fla"" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.","A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on ""best practices""",

It appears that the tutorial is built on Adobe Air, which make Javascript look positively robust and blazing. The interface is slow and quite unresponsive on a fast Mac. It's very frustrating that it is not aware of dual monitor setups either. There is an option to watch it full screen, but if you try to place the video tutorial on a second monitor -- which would be customary if the program you are trying to learn was on your main monitor -- clicking on ""full-screen"" jumps the tutorial to your main display and makes it full-screen there, covering up the Flash program!

The content and organization is pretty well done for beginner to intermediate level Flash programmers, but the numerous typos give it an  amateur whiff. How can there be typos in a video you ask? Well, the Video Training INSISTS on turning closed captioning on by default. No matter how many times you turn it off, when you relaunch the training, it appears again.

My ultimate verdict is not-bad, but not great. I would give this 2-1/2 stars if that were an option, but as it's not I will tip the favor to three stars for ambition.",Not without its problems!,
4.0,False,"10 21, 2010",A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,0321719824,Grimmy,"The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.

The lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.

As with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

All in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.","A good introduction to Flash, with some UI weaknesses",

It contains a DVD and a hundred page book supplement.  The DVD provides well-done video tutorials that you can follow along in watch-and-work mode using the starter work files included in the DVD, and the book provides useful reference materials (e.g., colored screenshots of user interfaces and how to use the various tool components, keyboard short cuts for specific tasks, etc.)

The video lessons cover all the important basics: how to create work projects and organize your files; how to use various tools and features; what are objects, shapes, symbols, movie clips, timelines, layers, frames, stage, etc; how to work with text and graphics; how to create animations such as objects moving in a choreographed fashion (motion tweens), or shapes morphing into other shapes (shape tweens); how to include ActionScript code snippets for more dynamic (but still simple) handling of events; how to build not just good-looking designs and presentations but also simple applications that react to text inputs, button presses, and mouse clicks; and how to test and deploy your work. By the time you're done with the lessons, you'll have an appreciation of how powerful Flash CS5 is and how learning even just the few techniques introduced in this video guide already empowers you to do interesting stuff!

The user interface for the video tutorials is easy to use, and although the book supplement comes with instructions on how to use that interface and navigate through the tutorials, most people should be able to figure out how to use the interface without having read those instructions first.

The video lessons are organized into eight chapters, most of which end with test questions that give you additional opportunities to revisit what you have just learned.  For the most part, the test questions quiz your knowledge of what was covered not just in the video lessons but also related materials in the book supplement; given that the video lessons and the chapters in the book supplement do not track each other perfectly (for example, the video lessons introduce motion tweens before shape tweens, but the supplement reverses this order), if you focus on the video lessons only, you might occasionally be surprised at getting quizzed on something that appeared unfamiliar by virtue of the fact that you might have missed reading some relevant materials presented (probably out of order) in the supplement.

Finally, I thought that while some of the materials in the video lessons are somewhat repetitious, the instructors have nevertheless done a good job showcasing some of the most useful features of Flash. Many students will appreciate how when covering features newly available only in the latest CS5 version of Flash, the instructors clearly demonstrate how these new features improve upon the replaced ""classic"" features by illustrating how both sets of features work.","Covers all important basics but also demonstrates how new features improve upon ""classic"" or pre-CS5 features",

Of course I can show the students everything there is to know about Flash but I always found it hard to find a complete training tool that students can use in the classroom and at home to complement my teachings.

Ended up just copying the DVD onto my computer and then using the files from there (but starting from the DVD itself) worked fine. Another thing I noticed is that when it opens up the tutorial screen is huge and not scalable. This to me is a royal pain because I wanted to work AND watch the video.

It was a simple program that, while not very attractive to look at, presented Japanese in a simple way that anyone could really understand. When I heard that there was a Human Japanese 2.0, I rushed to get the demo and eventually the full version.

Well, first let me talk about Human Japanese in general. As the name implies, the program tries to teach you Japanese in a ""Human"" way. Without fancy terminology or complicated explanations, but rather doing it in a way that a tutor might teach you. Giving you little hints to remember writing, or making silly acronyms to remember concepts, this program tries to do things like that. It certainly is refreshing to see that kind of teaching being used in a computer program.

Human Japanese 2.0 is broken up into 40 lessons, some focused on grammar while others try to steer the reader towards learning new words and expressions along with writing. At the end of each lesson, there is usually a quiz to test your knowledge of the things learned in that chapter. These can range from small multiple choice quizzes, matching games, and an ""Endless"" type quiz which tests your vocab.

Stuck in between every seven or so lessons are chapters devoted entirely to culture. These small 4-7 page bits are a treat to read. They talk about things like Geography, Prices in Japan, and Bathing among other things. Many more of these for Human Japanese 3.0 would certainly be nice.

The changes from Human Japanese 1 are certainly noticeable at first glance. The interface is changed from the plain white background of 1.0 to a nice background with shades of green and silhouettes of trees. There is now a small search bar on the right side of the screen to look up any vocab term that has appeared in the program. There are also visual aids added to the lessons which, while probably not amazingly helpful, do look nice.

Unfortunately, the changes from Human Japanese 1 are mainly visual. Although there are now 40 lessons, they are mostly just each of the 20 lessons from the previous version split into two lessons. This means that most of the 40 lessons are identical to content in the last version, although they tend to have a bit more meat on them (They are a bit longer, and most have a few extra vocab added).

The lessons are simple, yet effective, and contain lots of cultural and lingual information one could only discover by living in Japan.  I'm teaching English in Japan, and I even learned things I hadn't realized yet.

The style of writing is warm and has a conversational tone that keeps me reading.  That's something I think is really important when learning by book or even software.  It reads like a really knowledgable and interesting....friend.  The easy-access reference on the side let's you look up translations without jumping out of the lesson.  That's really convenient.

I've tried the declan software and the rosetta stone software and it's all about vocab and phrases or trying to make you remember the words through pictures.  Just reading the introduction chapter of Human Japanese really shows how much the makers of this software care personally about teaching the fundamentals of Japanese.  The other companies just make software for learning many languages to make money.

And I've just got to mention:  all the Japanese words in the text can be clicked on to hear the pronounciation.  It's really nice.  Also, there is a customizable review game for Japanese numbers.  It's awesome.  The Japanese number system is pretty simple, but listening to big numbers in any language is a pain.  The game will generate random numbers in the range you want and read them in Japanese and quiz you.

3.0,True,"06 20, 2014",AQ02W3BFJPDQ3,0615179088,Evan Shaw,"Pros
- Introduces Hiragana and Katakana characters by teaching stroke order and pronunciation. The characters are introduced little by little with the help of a quiz, making them much easier to memorize as opposed to learning them all at once.
- Helpful cultural notes are dispersed throughout the software
- Concepts are introduced in an easy to understand, conversational way
- Audio recordings for all Japanese words and phrases

Cons
- Too much vocabulary is introduced at one time
- The vocabulary and concept quizzes are awful. There is no way to choose how many or which words are used in the quiz, it just quizzes you on everything in the chapter at random and indefinitely, making the quiz practically useless for chapters that have a lot of vocabulary, like chapter 28, which has 39 pages.
- There are no exercises whatsoever, only readings that do not require any user input. Because of this, in my opinion, coupled with the horrible quizzes, retention is rendered almost impossible.
- Some concepts are introduced seemingly at random. For example, the particle ""ni"" is introduced in chapter 20, but the particle ""de"" isn't introduced until chapter 35... The problem with this is that both particles are very similar in meaning and it would make a lot more sense to explain both of them at the same time. The result for me was that, for a long time, I incorrectly used ""ni"" in places where ""de"" belonged.
- Verb conjugation isn't explained at all. This to me is the worst part of the software. When the author introduces verbs, he introduces them in their ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms instead of their dictionary forms. This makes it impossible to know what is actually happening to the verb. For example, when he introduces the verb ""iku"" (to go), he introduces it as ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"", providing no explanation for how ""ikimasu"" conjugates to ""itte"". In fact, the only way to know how this happens is to know that the dictionary form of ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"" is ""iku"", but he doesn't even mention it! There is also no mention of the difference between ""u"" verbs, ""ru"" verbs, and irregular verbs, leaving the user with the impression that the ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms must simply be committed to memory.
- There are several typos throughout the software, including a typo in one of the Japanese examples.

Other thoughts:
I bought this software as a result of not being able to take the first two intro Japanese classes at my college. I figured that if I used this software, I could opt into the third course and continue from there. My reason for choosing Human Japanese was that I thought it would be much less overwhelming compared to using a textbook. Fortunately, it was. However, if I could go back in time I would definitely choose to use the Genki textbook instead. I was able to opt into the third class, but after going through the first Genki textbook and doing all the exercises, I can say confidently that the Genki textbook isn't that difficult to navigate and far more rewarding and informative.",Go with Genki instead,9
5.0,True,"04 19, 2014",A2N7IYLK882T6F,0615179088,A. clay,"I was wanting to learn Japanese, not only to read and speak fluently, buy to be able to talk to myself without anyone knowing what i was saying. With this program, I am able to achieve my wish! This software is so down to earth and friendly, I am surprised I am not talking to an actual person.

I have had this software for a few months now, and when I get a break from my classes, I enjoy the time I spend learning this new language. There is one or two words placed wrongly in a sentence in English, but that is throughout the entire program, while its nothing to ponder on what they just said. You can also report it to Brak, and I am sure they will fix it.

How it works: At the beginning, there is a very mild and friendly introduction, that warms you up to what is coming later. Then, it gives you a tad but of history and few moments to tell you about the writing sysytem. Once that is over, it brings you through Hirigana, the first part, all the while showing you how to write the character and giving you a hint on how to write and how to remember it. Hirigana part 1 is over, now a few pages on the Geography of Japan. Now to Hirigana part 2! Once you have learned Hirigana, they launch you into an amazingly simple and easy introduction to Greetings and what to call things around the home, and explaining how verbs are used. There are 40 chapters, and I am only on 20, which is great, because I am at my own limit, as well as you can, either if you are slow or busy, or fast or in a rush. You need time for this though.

This software is cheap, as in the price, compared to Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone just starts flinging out words at you, where you have to figure out how to say it, and what it means, with no training under your belt. Not Human Japanese. I was about to buy a few books on how to speak and read Japanese, but i decided to go on a whim and purchase this software. I do not regret it, and it might have been the best 30 dollars i have ever spent......but i don't keep track. I am definitely going to buy Human Japanese Intermediate once I am done with this one. I am even hoping for them to do a Russian learning software.

Buy this if you are wanting a friendly, self paced software that you can have fun working through, but if you wished to be pushed through learning a language, and like to guess what your saying, go somewhere else. If this was 50 or 100 dollars, i would still buy it, and still say it is the best learning program i have ever used.

You're mostly reading, but when it comes time to look and learn words, you can click them to hear their pronunciation. Every Japanese sentence and word has voice dialogue for you to listen to if you choose.
I've been studying with this program for almost a month now and it has been extremely helpful. It really breaks things down and doesn't just tell you ""This means that."" but also explains ""(Why) This means that."" When learning about verbs and other particles such as 'wa', 'wo', 'ni', the programs takes great strides to explain how they attach to words, and how they are used in various situations and sentences.

The only problem I have with this program so far is that there isn't much it tries to do to help you remember anything. The few games it has at the end of some chapters are not very useful. You'll have to make your own methods or get some flashcards to memorize vocabulary. For learning the program is great, for exercising and remembering what you learn, not so much.

I've been trying to self-teach since May, and although I've found a good system for learning kanji I still struggle to work up the motivation to learn grammar. I find the brevity of the chapters to be refreshing and easy to work through.

The text seems to be well researched. It doesn't make the mistake of telling you that ""anata"" can be used just like we use ""you,"" for example (one thing I didn't like about my old textbook; some of the advice and info was outdated).

I'm someone who has never done well with languages in a classroom setting. For some reason, my brain doesn't seem to jive well with the way most foreign language teachers teach. Nothing sinks in, concepts don't 'click', and  after I somehow pass the class, I forget everything.

That's what nearly happened when I took Japanese 100 in college last semester. The class would simply whizz by while I can honestly say I learned next to nothing. Finally, the week of finals, I decided I needed to do something to get up to speed so I'd pass. I used Human Japanese for a few days and learned more than I did during the whole semester. Not only that, but the program helped me to realize just how simple some of the concepts were.

While textbooks tend to describe things in technical-speak that would confuse my understanding even of my native language, Human Japanese does what the name suggests and what the developer promises: it explains Japanese in a personal, human way that does wonders for teaching the new language to someone. I can't tell you how many times I finished learning a new concept and was surprised at just how simple it had been. This program inspires confidence in your ability to learn Japanese.

First, I'll start you off with a little history lesson so that you know where I'm coming from in relation to language. I'm one of those people, one of those thousands of people who simply didn't get language. A second language wouldn't STICK in my brain. As soon as I began to grasp a concept, it would slip. As many Americans do, I was forced (more or less) to take a second language to pass high school. I chose spanish, as it is a money making language in the US. All throughout my spanish career, I struggled. In no offense, I didn't like the language. I didn't care about the culture, I didn't care about anything at all in relation to Spanish except for passing the class. Well, needless to say, while I passed the class, I didn't learn a damn thing. I didn't know why, and assumed it was because I was just one of those thousands of people who just didn't get language. But I do understand language now. It's taken me to my third year of college and a linguistics class to understand WHY I never really learned spanish--and the answer is so simple I could slap myself. It was because I didn't CARE about it! True, you can ""learn"" something that you don't care about--but do you excel? How long does it stick in your brain? Do you remember it or do you actually LEARN it? Ask yourself this!! I realized that I don't give a rats hat about spanish, and that subconsciously affected my learning. But I desperately wanted to become bilingual, so I took a look at a culture and language that I DO care about...

**(This is what you want to read!)
The Human Japanese program is outstanding, amazing, enthralling, captivating, and any other positive ""-ing"" word you can think of. YES, MAC USERS, WE CAN GET IT. Just not here, search it in the Ap store, and you will find it for around 20 bucks (18.99 if my memory hasn't failed yet). Just as the other comments say, it is indeed HUMAN like. He is so warm, simple, and even kind of funny! He cracks a few jokes here and there, and relates tough or questionable subjects to things English speakers can understand. He even gives history lessons so that we can better understand the ""whys"" and the ""hows."" There are animations, a real Japanese woman helping with pronunciation, everything! I absolutely love the program. I admit, I've just start using it--but at the same time, I'm halfway through learning Higarana. And, these things STICK. I don't know how he does it, but he puts his information in a way that really does stay with you. I remember things from pages (the program reads like a warm, friendly book) ages ago. In spanish class, I couldn't remember things we've talked about SENTENCES ago. Best 20 bucks spent.

Now, if you WANT to learn another language, you LIKE Japan and are INTERESTED in the language, with no experience, Human Japanese is the program for you. You have to want to learn it, but when you do, Human Japanese is here to hold your hand. Buy it! I pray that he makes an intermediate and advanced levels, because I don't want to learn from anyone or anything else. :)

I think using a software is so much better than a book, especially if you don't have a teacher or friends who speak Japanese to help you pronounce words. Using Human Japanese it almost feels like I have a real teacher in front of me teaching. Plus it's a lot more fun than reading a book, since there are activities to help the information stick to your brain. It's not just a bunch of memorizing words, in Human Japanese you are actually taught how and when to use the words. Every Japanese word in the book is clickable and will pronounce it for you. Hearing it really helps. I like how the program breaks it up too, you go from learning vocab, to some culture information, to some new Hiragana/Katakana/etc. Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting, and helps a lot because you are slowly introduced into each topic, rather than thrown in and expected to memorize everything. Definitely a great program! Though you can get the digital download for a bit cheaper (I think I paid $19 on the Human Japanese website) if you don't care about having the hard copy of the disc.

I took some time of from using this software to learn some of the kanji (that is the one thing this software does not cover, although it does give an overview of kanji in one chapter) and also due to a death in the family. I just recently started back with my Japanese studies and started this software over. The software reads more like a book (a good book) and even covering the chapters I had already done before was entertaining. When I first started learning last year I struggled with the kana and was using boring hiragana and katakana workbooks. After switching to Human Japanese I breezed through learning the syllabaries and before I knew it, I was reading Japanese without the aid of romaji. The software slowly introduces hiragana, then katakana, then weens you off of the romaji. I hardly noticed this process happening, so it was the perfect pace for me!

English grammar was never a strong-point of mine. But this software does a great job of explaining the grammar and how it relates to English grammar and breaks it down so that it is easy to understand. Using this software, I've had several ""eureka moments"" where a concept made perfect sense after not being able to understand it using other methods of study.

So, being already learned from books and other software programs I was a bit hesitant to try another one and have to sit through the motions of basic Japanese BUT the way that they organize this software, it kind of lets you skip around so you're not sitting for hours through these boring automated lessons feverishly clicking the stuff you already know just so you can move on. Human Japanese is pretty open to the user so you can approach Japanese from whatever angle you want. I spent the first week with this software hitting the chapters I wanted to touch up on and found that their way of teaching is actually really comforting just like other reviewers have said.

So much in fact that I am now just going back over the stuff I 'already knew' and am constantly getting pleasantly surprised by the way that they explain those things. Like it makes even MORE sense now.

The writing style is calm with some mild jovial points that catch your attention, really it IS as if you are sitting there with a Japanese person and an American person, both fluent in the language and they are EXPLAINING it to you, point for point, making connections with English that really - I haven't even seen referenced in many books I own and I'm up to about 35. So as someone who has a growing horde of Japanese Language books, as someone who has sampled Rosetta Stone and as someone who gets confused easily coupled with NO attention span... this software is absolutely perfect for me. It's concise, gives examples, makes connections, doesn't overload you with rules and exceptions...

Overall, this is a great product for learning the basics of Japanese to an extent that allows basic communication, especially speech. The integrated audio files demonstrating pronunciation are a life saver and help demonstrate proper pitch accent to keep your own speech clear and comprehensible.

There's a lot of good vocabulary and grammar, and at the end of each chapter there are quizzes to help you judge how well you retained the material and also to practice. My only complaint is that the quizzes are often very large, making it difficult to learn smaller groups of vocabulary at a time, and that you are not able to generate custom, cumulative quizzes to test your knowledge overall.

Something I thought was lacking was the writing aspects. While the introduction to Hiragana is great, the material on Katakana is more stretched out, and many foreign words are first written in Hiragana because of your lack of knowledge in a certain chapter. Additionally, the Hiragana chapter has additional memory exercises, whereas the Katakana is limited to a matching game which isn't a particularly good way to memorize them. For this reason, I still haven't.

And finally, in my introductory college textbook, even a few kanji are introduced per chapter as the book goes on. I'm not saying this product should have hundreds of kanji to teach, but I feel introducing some of the more basic ones would have helped.

However, Human Japanese Intermediate should solve my kanji complaint, and I will of course purchase another amazing product from these developers.",Great Software for Language Learning,

5.0,False,"06 16, 2011",A3309IEQSU5WF9,0615179088,Amani2,"This is one of the best tools for complete beginners to Japanese. Human Japanese will teach you how to write the kana, why the Japanese writing system is the way it is, as well as basic grammar and about 1800 words/sentences (with good quality audio recorded by native speakers). Everything is explained clearly in plain English and I found it fun to use. I only have a few minor complaints:

-Human Japanese does not mention pitch/word accent. While Japanese does not have a ""stressed"" accent like English does, syllables can be low or high in pitch (similar to how our voice rises when we ask a question in English). However, the pitch accent is very obvious in the recordings, so as long as you model your pronunciation after the audio, you'll know how to say the words properly.
-This software briefly mentions whispered vowels, but only for ""su"" and not other vowels. When vowels come between certain consonants, they are often whispered. Again, if you copy the audio's pronunciation you'll be fine.
-The search functionality included in the software is helpful, but it only searches for key words, not the entire text. It would be nice if it showed all instances of a word.
-Another complaint is that words and sentences must mainly be learned through memorization. They are presented in a list format that is clickable with audio. There are short quizzes and games available to practice, but it would be cool if they made this part of the learning more interactive and fun, especially since this is software. The advantage of the list format is that it gets right to the point, so if you just want to learn words quickly without going through a bunch of animations, you can. It's more like an interactive textbook with good explanations.
-Additionally, since Human Japanese is a beginner course, it only gives an introduction to kanji and doesn't cover all the grammar found in a regular textbook. Its purpose is to give you the confidence that you can study Japanese, even by yourself! For what it teaches, the price is right.

It's easy to be overwhelmed by Japanese as a beginner because it is completely backwards from English. Textbooks often assume that you already know how to write the kana and they don't explain the basics in much detail. It's a shame that most textbooks aren't suited for self-learning beginners, but that's where Human Japanese excels. After finishing this course, you'll have a very solid foundation and be able to jump into any popular Japanese textbook series.

If any of my friends ask me what they should use to start learning Japanese, I'm definitely going to recommend this. It's suitable and friendly for just about anyone with an electronic device. I don't think I can say that about the majority of language materials I own. I really hope this company makes more advanced levels, as well as versions for other languages. I'm also trying to learn some Chinese right now and a Human Chinese would be wonderful!

Instead of reading reviews, just go to the Human Japanese website and try it out for yourself. There is a demo available for your browser as well as a downloadable version for Windows. It goes through 8-12 chapters depending on the demo, and there are 40 chapters total, so you should be able to get a good feel for the full version. Human Japanese is also available for the Mac on the Mac App Store, as well as the iPhone, Android, and Windows 7 phones. For the phones there is also a free ""Lite"" version, which I downloaded prior to writing this review. The phone versions seem to be the same as the PC/Mac ones. I haven't used the phone app much, but it lists the same 40 lessons and the first few chapters have the same exact text and audio. It's obviously a bit easier to read the text on my computer screen than on my phone, but the formatting looks fine.

If you want to learn through software and you've thought about trying Rosetta Stone, get this instead. It's much better ""bang for your buck"" than Rosetta Stone and you'll have a more thorough understanding of how the Japanese language works. It doesn't cover as much vocabulary as Rosetta Stone or use pictures, but there are so many other cheaper (and more efficient) methods to build vocabulary, such as Anki, a free flashcard software, with user-shared flashcard decks (some even include pictures and audio).

Overall, 9/10.

If you are looking for an audio program, too, I really like Michel Thomas' Beginners Japanese course. Similar to Human Japanese, it will give you a nice start to speaking and basic grammar. I think it would complement this software well.

5.0,False,"05 12, 2011",A3IXP5VS847GE5,0615179088,Dragonflies &amp; Autumn Leaves,"My situation: Both my 8 y.o. son and I are learning Japanese together.  I have taken one year of Japanese in college, my husband speaks some, and we have access to native speakers.  That said, mostly I am a beginner needing a simple, clear, and accurate text that we can use for self-study.

We are using the i-pod touch application of Human Japanese (which is very handy to carry around in your pocket and use to practice pronunciation and what-not where ever you happen to be.)

Reasons this software stands out:

  -I LOVE that I can instantly hear the pronunciation of any Japanese words or sentences simply by touching them.  Japanese writing is introduced immediately, so this is very helpful in building your reading skills and  pronunciation at the same time, which is the only effective way to do it.  This is a HUGE improvement over my college text books, where one has to pop in separate audio C.D.'s to hear the lesson's vocabulary.  With Human Japanese you see it and hear it together all at the same time, and it's easy to access.

  -I love that the hiragana and katakana are animated, so you can see how it is drawn simply by touching it.

  - The explanations and layout are easy and enjoyable to read.  My son enjoys reading the lessons to me in the car, and is not intimidated or confused by it.
It's clear this is someone who knows from experience what would be useful to an English speaker learning Japanese (and is no doubt creating the text he WISHED he had when learning.)

My son and I have been taking a very leisurely pace and are on chapter 10 after about 5 months.  This is mostly due to wanting to get the kana down solidly, and having the limitations of an 8 y.o. attention span.  We aren't doing tons of talking yet, but the delay is worth having a comfortable reading relationship with the kana.  I have skimmed ahead and the other chapters seem well done.

I do find it helpful to do some supplementing:

 We could not remember all the hiragana and katakana characters so easily, so we made our own charts, and would quiz ourselves by drawing the characters in the air, until we could do them from memory.  I highly suggest printing out two blank 10 by 5 box grids (plus one drawn in for ""n"") and making a hiragana and katakana chart for yourself.  You can easily print out a chart from the web for reference, but making your own really helps the memory.  We have used practice print outs from a Japanese website for kids, that are fabulous, with cute pictures for the characters that teach you simple words at the same time.  They have corresponding Hiragana and Katakana charts.  The site is kids dot nifty dot com fowardslash study forwardslash index dot htm
The chart with the yellow background is the hiragana, the mint-green is the katakana, and the pictures with the pink ice cream and candy are the worksheets.

This, however, is only to supplement: Human Japanese will teach you what need to know about the characters...this just gives extra practice to those who need to write it themselves, and see it all in a chart in one spot.

For the numbers chapter I found myself wanting to know what the Kanji for the numbers are, and looking that up on the web.  I wish it had been included in the lesson, even if we weren't technically covering Kanji yet.  Same thing for the days of the week.  I found helpful info. fairly easily online for this [...], and also a more useful way of understanding the number units ""man"" (10,000) and ""oku"" (100,000,000) by showing them grouped by 4 places instead of three (shift that comma over so you get 1,0000 and 1,0000,0000.)  This is a small thing, but very useful for understanding what is going on with the numbers, and I'm surprised it wasn't presented that way.

Despite me wanting to supplement here and there, this is a great program to use as the backbone of your beginning study.

The software is simple (that is what makes it great) and does not take up much room on your Hard Drive Disk.  The software is broken into chapters with each new items learned ending with a game or trivia to test your knowledge.  The software is mostly written text that you have to read (it does not read to you).  The text is fun and engaging, and offers many interesting topics from the origin or the language to the history and geography of Japan.  It breaks learning into manageable parts, so you are not too overwhelmed.  The software runs smoothly and offers many spoken parts (pronunciation of new words).  Once you are done for the day all you have to do is exit out and when you reopen in the future it starts right back where you left off at.  This software is more like reading a book and having interactive studying materials, but that is exactly what I want.  Something that is easy to start and can be completed at my own pace.  I highly recommend the product and hope that there are future releases that offer advance studying on top of what it learned in this edition.

I can't believe it's only $25 when programs like Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur cost more than  $300. It's well thought-out, with interesting tidbits on how the Japanese language compares to English in terms of numbers of syllables, writing, how it evolved from its initial use of Chinese characters. Very interesting stuff. The tone is conversational, as if you were learning from a live teacher who also has a sense of humor. For example, here's an excerpt from chapter 3: Hiragana:

""If Japanese used only Hiragana and Katakana, it would be one of the simplest writing systems in the world. Alas, the picture is a bit more complicated than that. See, when Hiragana was invented, Chinese characters didn't just roll over and die. Keep in mind that Kanji were associated with wealth, power, and education. So for centuries, most of the people who had those things continued to write extensively in Kanji.""

It's hard to be bored with stuff like that.

I've tried using Pimsleur, but the repetitive, listening-only method doesn't work for me. After saying ""I understand/I don't understand"" 10 times in all its variations, I had to stop. And I was only in the middle of the first 20-or-so-minute less.

Human Japanese is different because it's engaging. You can click on words to hear the pronunciations, but you can see the romanized spelling of Japanese words and/or the kana and/or the kanji. This is what language-learning should entail--seeing, hearing, and speaking (which you do to yourself, of course). I only wish that Human Japanese had a recording function, like the ""Talk Now!"" series does, which allows you to record your pronunciation and play it back. Then you can determine whether your pronunciation is off or spot-on.

I'll have to get to later chapters (or the end) to give a more detailed review.","Like learning from a live, patient teacher",2

My biggest thing, is that I feel like I got my monies worth out of this product, unlike a lot of costly programs currently on the market. For 25 bucks you get 40 chapters of dense vocab and grammar notes, along with cute cultural notes. My only criticism would be that for certain chapters its difficult to remember the vocab with it just listed.

I would have also been really happy if instead of listing the hiragana or katakana he showed the kanji of the word to the side, so I won't have to go back and re-learn them.

To me, this is simply the best place to start your Japanese learning. It gives you a solid foundation in the basics of Japanese writing, grammar, sentence structure, culture, and gets you over many of the hurdles that beginning Japanese learners face.

This product is an amazing deal, in my opinion. For such a low price, you learn so much, you enjoy learning it, and you actually remember what they teach. This software is like a favorite, enjoyable book that you just can't put down.

Some of my favorite features of this program:
- Awesome cultural tidbits and information about Japan and geography!
- Useful vocabulary and phrases and a way to look up any Japanese word that the program uses!
- A warm, inviting approach that makes it HUMAN and not like a textbook.
- The tech support is amazing. The creators are really nice, always trying to improve their software and bring it to new places and levels. They respond immediately.

What's in it for you?
- If you don't know hiragana and katakana, you'll learn how to write it, stroke order, stroke number, and little tips to remember how to write the kana well. If you're like me and already know it, it can give you a nice refresher course!
- Culture, history, geography, and more presented in a way that keeps you interested.
- Nice, clear photographs and clear male and female speaking voices.
- Dialogue that helps you learn to recognize speech patterns, sentence patterns, vocabulary, and learn to read hiragana and katakana at the rate they are speaking, instead of relying on romaji.
- Easy to navigate chapters and reviews. Reviews that include flash cards and the very helpful vocabulary quizzes.
- Compliments books and other learning methods well, and is a great, easy to use reference for anything you need a refresher on - like wa and ga, or what that darn word for kitchen is.

This product is simply excellent. It is a MUST buy. Don't believe me? Try the demo on their website.

I had taken part of a semester of Japanese at the city college and boy was I disappointed.  I have a good deal of language learning experience and I just felt like the teacher I had was making it way too complicated (although I think she was trying to make it easier in her defense).  It really isn't all that difficult of complex a language.  It's simply mysterious because of the writing system and grammar differences.

Here's my advice.  Take the hiragana and write down the first ten characters.  Repeat repeat repeat until you can do it from memory.  Then add ten more.  Repeat procedure.  You will have all of your hiragana and katakana down in no time.  Honestly, a couple of days would suffice if you really want to learn it quickly.  Once you have that down, you will feel like you have your feet on the ground and the rest will not be so scary.  If you would like to practice, you can google ""hiragana practice"" or something like that and find quite a few little quizzes or games, etc.  That's a good way to keep it current.

Anyway, Human Japanese is exactly that, human.  It's not going to treat you like a robot student and try to program you with information.  Expect to be told digestable amounts of information.  It will obviously be quite different than English, so just accept it and move on.  Things will start to come together before long and you will find there are some things you actually understand.  This is encouraging.  Now and then, bits and pieces of cultural knowledge will come up to break up the lessons and keep it from getting boring.

I must say this is GREAT learning software.  Many competitive software products either spend too much time on memorizing phrases or random vocabulary, focus too much on pedantic grammar rules, or make little or no attempt to present the written word in Japanese.  Human Japanese is, in my opinion, the BEST in integrating the spoken with the written word.  You will learn plenty of grammar but it is presented in a user-friendly way. You will get lots of vocabulary, and you will be recognizing sentences in kana before you know it.

If you're just getting into Japanese, this is the best $24.95 you'll ever spend in your learning endeavors. It's essentially a sensei-in-a-box.

The writing style is genuine and interesting, and it almost feels like the conversation of a close friend. It compels one to read further and takes away any sense of learning as a chore.

3.0,False,"10 12, 2011",A2R3CJCDNC1KO1,0669524425,Laura,"This program and the other Earobics titles are clearly designed for North American users.

This is a shame because most of the activities work quite well.

However as a previous user mentioned - there are still af few glitches in there - thankfully not many.

What is more problematic is the English vs American accents.

Some of the differences are very frustrating for the kids, and leaves them stranded on the same level, unable to progress.

In the Fireman sounds game - the short vowels u and o sound almost identical.

For English speakers (UK, Australia, NZ, Sth Africa etc) these sounds are very different.
with the short 'u' sound clearly being pronounced 'uh' as in 'cup' or 'but'
and the short 'o' sound pronounced as 'o' as in 'cot' or 'orange'

However the Nth Amercian pronounciation of the short 'o' sounds very close to the 'u'/'uh', and comes out sounding somewhere between 'ah' and 'awe'.
So instead of 'cot' it sounds like 'c-ah-t' ... which is ok in the word recognition as there are the surrounding letters to help with the sound interpretation.
However in the individual short vowel sound recognition - it's quite hard and confusing for the kids, as it's clearly very different to what they learn in school English classes.

Similarly for the Pengiun game where there are sounds syllables given for words which are just confusing for the kids' spelling.
eg lemon ... instead of being sounded out as le-mon ... is sounded out as le-min
chicken ... instead of being sounded out as chi-cken ... is sounded out as chick-in
kitchen ... instead of being sounded out as kit-chen ... is sounded out as kit-chin

Finally the Hippo - find the mismatched sound in the sequence game, has very similar problems to the o/u issues above, along with r/l, with the kids getting stranded on a level unable to progress. At times, even as an adult who is well versed in accents - I cant hear the difference between the ruh/luh/rah/lah. The audio is also quite clipped short ... so this makes it even more difficult to determine what sound is being said.

Summary:
The Pirate/Parrot word/syllable matching games and the Luck Duck sound/syllable/word recognition games don't seem to suffer from these issues.

The beginner & intermediate levels of the Fireman sound recognition game are also good. With the English/American accent confusions only arising in the advanced level games.

Apart from the pronounciation issues - the Penguin game works well too.

Probably the most frustrating one is the Hippo game as the kids can easily get stuck on each of 8 the beginner tasks without progressing at all. Any background noise can make it impossible to hear the subtle sound differences, which are not familiar to non-American accent speakers.

***
The games are repetitive by nature, so can become a bit boring. So offer some kind of incentives to get them thru it. We did the program over the school spring break - getting thru all the beginner & intermediate levels within 2 weeks, except the Hippo, which I'm considering abandonning if the higher levels' audio isn't clearer as it's too frustrating.",Good - but watch out for non-American accents,7

3.0,False,"10 12, 2011",A2R3CJCDNC1KO1,0669524115,Laura,"This program and the other Earobics titles are clearly designed for North American users.

This is a shame because most of the activities work quite well.

What is more problematic is the English vs American accents.

Some of the differences are very frustrating for the kids, and leaves them stranded on the same level, unable to progress.

(This review is of Earobics Step 2 - but also applies to the other Earobics titles.)

In the Fireman sounds game - the short vowels u and o sound almost identical.

For English speakers (UK, Australia, NZ, Sth Africa etc) these sounds are very different.
with the short 'u' sound clearly being pronounced 'uh' as in 'cup' or 'but'
and the short 'o' sound pronounced as 'o' as in 'cot' or 'orange'

However the Nth Amercian pronounciation of the short 'o' sounds very close to the 'u'/'uh', and comes out sounding somewhere between 'ah' and 'awe'.
So instead of 'cot' it sounds like 'c-ah-t' ... which is ok in the word recognition as there are the surrounding letters to help with the sound interpretation.
However in the individual short vowel sound recognition - it's quite hard and confusing for the kids, as it's clearly very different to what they learn in school English classes.

Similarly for the Pengiun game where there are sounds syllables given for words which are just confusing for the kids' spelling.
eg lemon ... instead of being sounded out as le-mon ... is sounded out as le-min
chicken ... instead of being sounded out as chi-cken ... is sounded out as chick-in
kitchen ... instead of being sounded out as kit-chen ... is sounded out as kit-chin

Finally the Hippo - find the mismatched sound in the sequence game, has very similar problems to the o/u issues above, along with r/l, with the kids getting stranded on a level unable to progress. At times, even as an adult who is well versed in accents - I cant hear the difference between the ruh/luh/rah/lah. The audio is also quite clipped short ... so this makes it even more difficult to determine what sound is being said.

Summary:
The Pirate/Parrot word/syllable matching games and the Luck Duck sound/syllable/word recognition games don't seem to suffer from these issues.

The beginner & intermediate levels of the Fireman sound recognition game are also good. With the English/American accent confusions only arising in the advanced level games.

Apart from the pronounciation issues - the Penguin game works well too.

Probably the most frustrating one is the Hippo game as the kids can easily get stuck on each of 8 the beginner tasks without progressing at all. Any background noise can make it impossible to hear the subtle sound differences, which are not familiar to non-American accent speakers.

***
The games are repetitive by nature, so can become a bit boring. So offer some kind of incentives to get them thru it. We did the program over the school spring break - getting thru all the beginner & intermediate levels within 2 weeks, except the Hippo, which I'm considering abandonning if the higher levels' audio isn't clearer as it's too frustrating.",Good - but watch out for non-American accent speakers,16

There aren't many options out there, but earobics has been a lifesaver for me.  There are other programs out there that are more time consuming and expensive (Fast Forward I believe).  So when I found Earobics I was quite pleased with this home version.  Nick can do as much or as little of it that he wants in a day.  It has helped his listening skills so far.  It has helped his short term and long term memory.  I have been very pleased with his progress in his language and listening skills.  HIs expressive and recessive skills are growing everyday.

There are different games that build on different listening skills.  It has many different levels.  You can go at your own speed.  I can hit the repeat button if Nick needs more time to process what has been said.  There is alot of room for improvement in Nicks listening skill and there are many different levels and games on this disk that we will be working on for years to come.  It is rated for 4 and above.

For better or worse, Ribbon interface is here to stay.  Is there something new that Microsoft can bring to the table?

I write as a sole proprietor who has been using Office 365 Enterprise for half a year.  I installed Office 2013 RTM (i.e. final version) about a month earlier than the official release in late January 2013.  My review will answer 1) why and who should upgrade to Office 2013 and 2) which version (Home & Business, Pro, Office 365 Home Premium, Small Business or Enterprise) to choose.

For Q1 (who should and why upgrade), my short answer is: upgrade if you are: a) using a touch computer; b) you own several computers and use all of them to edit the same documents; c) you are running on a slow computer and wants some extra speed.  Otherwise there is no need to upgrade from 2007/2010.  2003 users will have to decide whether they want to make the switch to Ribbon.

1A - Using a touch computer
I own a Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro, a Windows 8 Pro tablet.  Office 2013 automatically recognizes the touchscreen and increases the spacing between icons for me.  Frankly the increased spacing is not much use on my 11.6 inch display as mis-clicks are still frequent.  I still resort to the built-in pen for clicking the small icons (Save, undo etc).

More importantly, the new version supports gestures such as pinch to zoom and flicking the screen to scroll.  This, together with Windows 8 Pro, make touch experience almost bearable on a PC.

Of course, to truly take advantage of Office 2013's touch function, you also need Windows 8.  The on-screen keyboard in Windows 8 is simply better than the one in Windows 7.  The most important improvement is the maximize icon next to the X button of the keyboard.  Press it, and the keyboard becomes ""one with the taskbar"".  The app will not occupy the space beneath the keyboard and make itself inaccessible (because the keyboard floats above it).

Word now supports a Reader mode, which is HUGELY useful and makes me want to convert all my ePub to word documents.  The idea is simple: Word reflows the text to single column/double columns while maintaining certain formatting like italic, fonts, highlighting etc and discarding others (tabs, line spacing for example).  This is similar to what we experience from other eReaders (Amazon Kindle, ePub readers etc).  The great thing about reading document in Word 2013 is that you can save your annotation directly on the file - there is no need to worry about syncing annotation.  Contrast this to reading ePub - each software saves its own annotation file that cannot be easily read by another software.

1B - Multiple computers, one document
Having multiple computers is both a blessing and a curse.  Nothing beats turning off your office computer and take an early leave, knowing that whatever you failed to complete can be finished at home.  However it is a nightmare to learn that the document (or the newest version of it) is not available when you arrive at home.

There are many ways to transfer files from office to home, from the tedious (USB, manual or software assisted) to the care-free (dropbox automatic sync).  Your organization may or may not allow USB drives (for good reasons).  Dropbox requires administrative privilege which 99% of the working force do not have.  With Office 2013 you have a third option - save to your own Skydrive.  If you purchase the non-subscription version, you get 7GB space of Skydrive, Office 365 Home Premium gives you 27GB.  For the business version, storage depends on the base subscription and add-on plans.  Skydrive is like a USB stick that connects to your computer through the Internet.  You can create folders, save files, read files, delete files just as you would on a USB stick.  The difference is that it is always available as long as you have connection to the Internet.

To save to Skydrive, you must first have a Microsoft Live account.  If you have a Hotmail/outlook.com email account, you already have one.  You can also register a Live Account with any email you own (gmail Yahoo university mail).  You then login to this Live account from within Office, you only need to do it once for each computer, and you can do it in Excel/Word/etc.  After you have logged in, you can Save the document to Skydrive by pressing the icon linking to your skydrive, and you will be prompted with your Skydrive's folder structure - just as what you would see if you were to save on C drive.  To open a file, choose Open, then press the icon to your skydrive, and viola - your file is there.  A little icon called Office Upload Assistant on bottom right area next to the clock (the notification area) tells you whether all documents have been uploaded.

I also like the fact that opening Word 2013 shows you a Welcome screen with built-in templates AND YOUR OWN TEMPLATES (provided they are saved in Skydrive/locally).  No longer do you need to go through layers of folders before finding the template for Invoice etc.  You can also ""pin"" your favorite templates so that they are one-click away from being created.  You can of course still create new documents from templates the way you would in 2007/2010.

1C - Performance
Performance is BIG thing nowadays.  Finally Microsoft saw the need to reduce the footprints of its software and make them more suitable for the ""average"" machines.  It used to be the case that business machines are evaluated by how many Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word can be opened simultaneously while running on Windows Vista!

Having used the RAM-eating Office 2007 and the atrociously slow Office 2010, Office 2013 breathes new life to my 4 years old Dell Latitude E4200 (running on an ultra-low voltage dual-core Penryn processor).  I used to uncheck Outlook when I re-installed Office 2007/2010 because they start up painfully slowly.  The speed of Outlook 2013 is almost tolerable (about 7 seconds).  Outlook 2013 also does not cause my notebook to stutter.

The re-sizing on Word has also been improved.  It no longer draws accurate snapshots of the document as you zoom.  Instead it ""blurs"" the document as you zoom, and after you have settled on the zoom level, it draws a final, accurate snapshot.  It may not seem much, but coming from a computer-engineering background, I suspect this reduces CPU workload (and thus energy use) significantly.

Saving, opening, and switching between Ribbon tabs now feel instant even on my crappy 4 years-old laptop.  On my new Samsung tablet (sporting the newest Intel processor), starting Word is instant and outlook takes a mere 2 seconds to show.  The whole experience is very much like using an iPad, where every app loads instantaneously.

New features
I can only comment on Word, Onenote and Outlook 2013, which I use daily.  I will let my more knowledgeable fellow reviewers comment on the rest.

Word 2013
New features include the reader mode, touch-icons, touch gestures (mentioned above).

Track Changes is now infinitely more useful as it shows comments like a conversation.  The new Office Store allows you to install third-party apps (such as Merriam-Webster Dictionaries) to increase functionality.  You no longer need to ""hunt"" for plug-ins as you would for all previous versions.

You may or may not need the add pictures from an online location function.  The ability to embed YouTube video is also of dubious use - I prefer saving the youtube video offline, convert it and send it as an attachment to the word document.  This way my client won't ring me at 2am complaining they cannot view the clip (whether it is due to their connection to YouTube or some technical problem I do not care to solve), but this is just me.

The much-touted PDF manipulation is trash.  It seems that whatever PDF file I open using Word 2013, formatting is heavily messed up.  Apparently Microsoft tries to convert PDF to DOCX first before you can do any meaningful operation.  You are better off with a software that treats PDF as a PDF, such as the cheap but excellent PDF-XCHANGE software suites.

OneNote 2013
I could not be bothered to compare the feature sets between OneNote MX (free with Windows 8) and OneNote 2013.  It suffices to note that MX has fewer features but a more touch-centric control.
OneNote still does not get the degree of formatting control like Word.  You cannot make multi-layered lists or format text (and change formatting) using an umbrella category (like the Body, Heading 1, Heading 2).  Still, I enjoy jotting notes with OneNote much more than with Word.  Lists just indent to the proper place EVERY SINGLE TIME and there is no need to deal with page breaks.

I cannot think of any new features that are worth mentioning.  Onenote 2010 already had some sort of integration with the predecessor to Skydrive (called Live Drive).  The auto-correct still does not correct Recognise to Recognize etc (as Word 2013) does.  You can still add Online picture as you do in Word 2013.  There is also a new helper software that sits on the Taskbar and help you get screen capture quicker.  I always turn off the helper software because it adds unnecessary complexity to my taskbar.

Outlook 2013
Microsoft has not gone enough to change Outlook 2013.  Just as 2007/2010, it is extremely difficult to change account settings such as whether to download headers only or full text (with or without attachments).  The data file (OST or PST) still reside in the elusive place of C:\User\(user name)\AppData instead of your own ""My Document"" folder.  Sure you will forget to back that up as you re-install windows?  You also cannot see all emails using an ""Unified Inbox"" as you would with a 2-year old android phone/iPhone without using a script (search unified inbox vba if you really want to know)

Outlook has always struggled to find a proper interface.  I still recall using Outlook 2000 and being greeted with a Today's screen which shows some of my unread emails and upcoming appointments in extremely small fonts.  Outlook 2013 is better, when you start it shows you the Inbox, and you can quickly switch to appointments/contacts from the bottom left huge icons.

One new feature is integration with Facebook/other social networks.  The idea is to merge your contacts with Facebook's contacts.  I only connected about 20% of my friends because Outlook doesn't know Charles Jeremy Moore in outlook is really Charles Moore on Facebook.  You can of course manually link them as you could in the People app in Windows 8, but I cannot be bothered.

Assuming you have linked facebook contacts with Outlook, you can see a snapshot of your friend's profile while reading his email.  Useful?  I doubt it.  It is not often the case that your business associates will write something you absolutely must know business-wise (gossiping is another matter).  If there is some blogs/feeds you must read, the recommended course is to setup an RSS feed and read it regularly.  Stumbling upon someone's relationship status only distracts you from the current work.

It may or may not be a new feature, but pinning Outlook 2013 to your taskbar allows you to create tasks/appointments quickly.  Right-click the icon (not left click) and you will be greeted with a short-cut for New Appointment/Email/Contact/Task/Meeting.  What is best is that using any of the above will not launch Outlook 2013, not the whole program at least.  It is extremely handy for adding new appointments etc when you are talking on phone.  The ability to quickly add appointment from Outlook 2013 is one of the reasons I ditched Google in favour of my Office 365 Exchange account for storing calendars and contacts.  (note: Outlook 2013 cannot sync with Gmail's Exchange ActiveSync as of now, Outlook blames Google for not having the newest Exchange version).
WARNING: do not use the New Email function from the right click menu.  After you have typed your email, it is stored at the Outbox but NOT send out.  You have to launch Outlook to send it.  I cannot understand what Microsoft is thinking...

2 - Comparison
I have been using Office 365 to host my business email address and website for half a year, so I am familiar with the subscription model.

Feature-wise Office Pro and Office 365 is the same (but note the difference in Skydrive storage).  Simple math tells us that the price for Office Pro equates 4 years of Office 365.  The catch for purchasing Office Pro is that you are limited to 1 PC while Office 365 covers 5.  If you own more than 1 device, Office 365 is a no-brainer, or so it seems.

The reason why I gave Office Pro 5 stars while Office 365 Home Premium 3 stars is solely based on Price alone.  If you are a sole proprietor/small business, you are better-off with the Office 365 business plans (as I am subscribing).  If you are a Home User, as the name Home Premium suggest, I make the following assumptions: 1) your company pays for the office licence in your work computer(s) and 2) you do not have more than 1 home computer that needs Office.  Under this assumption the 5 PC advantage practically falls away.  The remaining question is whether you will upgrade in 4 years and whether the extra storage matters.

4 years is a bit longer than 1 product cycle (see 2003 - 2007-2010-2013).  If you will buy/subscribe Office 2016/2017 (if there is one) when it is released, then subscribing to Home Premium will present better value.  If you will skip one product cycle (i.e. skipping 2016/2017 and purchase 2020/2021), then Office Pro is better value.  I think most home users can afford to lag behind more than 1 product cycle.  New products are not always better, often the new features are useless to a home user and the new interface just spells frustration.

I think Office 365 HP is only appeal to users who match every criterion below:
1) You need Outlook/Access/Publisher
2) You have more than 1 computer
3) You plan to receive the next Office as it becomes available
4) You are not benefitted by Office 365 business versions

Regarding 1) above, most home users need Word/Excel/Powerpoint only, and their needs are well served by the cheaper Home versions.  Please note that if you do not use Outlook now, you probably won't need it in the future.  It is an overkill for checking gmail etc.  Access and Publisher require you to sit down and learn, possibly taking 1 month each before you fully appreciate their use and advantage over Excel/Word.  There is no point in going for Office Pro or Office HP just to get all software and be ""future-proof"" if Office Home Student/Home Business is good enough.

If you are willing to pay so much for the extra software (Outlook/Publisher/Access), but doesn't receive a free licence from your company, chances are that you work at a SMB.  SMBs stand to benefit A LOT from Office 365 business (see below), and even though you may not implement all the features, Office 365 business is still worth considering.

Office 365 Home Premium is expensive compared with Office 365 Enterprise.  At $20/Month Office 365 Enterprise gives you all Office software, your own exchange email account, Sharepoint and Lync (basic) servers.  The website shows Office Professional Plus 2010, but you can download Office 2013 RTM from TechNet and use your Office 365 login name to get the software running.  That was how I got Office 2013 a month earlier than the general public.

I wish only to add that regardless of whether you use Office 365 HP or Office 365 Ent, Office Web App is trash.  The idea of being able to edit document from a web-browser (running on an iPad maybe) is attractive, but unrealistic.  The reasons are: 1) Web App only supports DocX etc formats, but not the old formats; 2) more importantly, formatting is often MESSED UP when you use Web App.

More coming: the benefit of having your own exchange account and more importantly sharepoint server (in the coming week) and why it is much better value to sole proprietor/small business.","Touch interface, faster performance, business subscription may have better value",235

I knocked two stars off because, among other things, Outlook 2016 doesn't have a unified Inbox.  Each email address has it's own .pst.  So, if you have multiple email accounts, you'll either need to look through multiple inboxes for your mail, or write a rule to direct all your accounts into a new .pst you'll create.  I did this, but that's not without its problems, too.  Unbelievable.  I like POP email because it resides on my local machine, and can be easily searched.  It's obvious Microsoft, in this version, wants you to use IMAP, which does no more than show you a picture of what's already in your web based email accounts.  The argument is that IMAP allows you to check email from multiple devices, but with POP you can still leave email on the server by simply checking a box (Gmail, etc).  And, IMAP makes searching for a key word among all your emails impossible.  I like the 5 machine licenses, but would rather have Outlook 2007 than this.  The forums are filled with complaints about Outlook 2016, and thus far, Microsoft is unresponsive.","If You Liked Outlook Before, You Might Not Like The 2016 Version",2

Further, 36 new ""important updates"" started appearing with windows updater. QuickBooks absolutely would not reinstall or repair from the product DVD. Thank heavens for Revo Uninstaller.

I downloaded Office 365 on a brand new computer from Dell. Went through all updates to Windows 10 to make sure I was at the latest and greatest release. Mapped network drives and verified I could access files on the NAS (Network Attached Server) I have on our home network. So far so good. This is when I installed Office 365; note that Office 2007 not yet installed on this machine. I have 3 other PCs, one of which is an old laptop (7 years) which this new pc is to replace. All of the others PCs are running Windows 10, Office 2007 and dta stored on the NAS working just fine.

Office 365 installs fine and I of course check for and install all Office updates. I am able to open files from the NAS but every time I do so I get the protected view warning that documents downloaded from the internet could be unsafe. Not wanting to have to click enable for that warning every time for the rest of my life for any file that I open from the NAS I went to make my NAS location a Trusted Location. But when I follow Microsoft's instructions on how to do that I get the ""cannot do this for security reasons error"". Sigh - Microsoft has now made it irritating and unnecessarily complex to use my home network. SO I look on the web and find this is not an uncommon problem but the homebrew solutions out there involve editing the registry or other equally arcane solutions involving trusting someone on the web's incantation to fix it - ""really it will, just trust me"".

Next step - call Microsoft Tech support. I'll bet you can guess how that turned out. I quickly exhaust the minuscule competence of the first level support, but to be fair all I really expected was for them to be able to send me to someone who had competence beyond check the power cord and on button.  So I get a scheduled time for Tier 2 to call me back . Fair enough. I get a call from Tier 2 asking me what is the issue. So all the work I spent explaining the issue to the first help person was wasted. This would prove to be a recurring theme since I would have to start all over with each new person. So this expert asked to take remote control of my machine. OK. Then they turned off protected view entirely, which meant I would be eliminating security for the entire internet. Not what I needed. So took the time to step her through the process of Trusted Locations and explained I just wanted to trust my NAS, not the entire hacking community. She was able to see the error message, but had no idea how to troubleshoot this. Fair enough - I expected that she would pass me on to the next tier and to a technician  who specialized in the area. But  instead she asked to take a few minutes to confer with her team. OK - I appreciate someone who wants to figure things out and is willing to consult with teammates. A little while later she comes back and wants to try everything but this time as an administrator. Good idea but doesn't work. Then here is the stunner - she asked if I could call an IT person. I thought she meant a Microsoft help IT person at first, but no she meant did I have an IT person somewhere in the home. I then patiently explained that I was the person who set up my PCs and Home network and that It all worked just fine on the other machines. She basically said I am out of luck then.  What?!?!  SO I stated I would need to get a refund. That of course prompted her to say she would transfer me over to the commercial side, could I please hold while she transferred me. Now we're getting somewhere! Nope!  I talked with the commercial side operator, explain yet again the issue and she asks for my domain email account. I do not have one. She says they cannot help a home user. She gives me another phone number. I call it and give them my case number again and explain the issue again only to find out I am back at the basic help desk again. But the help desk person says the even though this is an issue found in Office, it is likely a Windows function causing the problem. He sends me on to the Windows tech support. After waiting on hold for 37 minutes and 17 seconds I finally arrive at a human being, She asks me to please tell her what the issue is. Since I have had plenty of practice by now I can recite it quickly and subconsciously. She states that she would have to escalate the problem so would I please hold, but then we are disconnected and I never receive a call back. I call back to tech support, they say it was unacceptable that I should have to wait so long. I agreed. But they would have to escalate the issue to a higher tier and would it be okay if they called back in 30 minutes to an hour. After verifying they had the correct phone number I thanked him for his time and hung up. And that's the last I heard from Microsoft. Several hours wasted...

So then in about 30 minutes I was able to install Office 2007 on the new machine, check and install all the latest updates,  map the network drives, and verify the proper functioning without even having to set trusted locations - and - bonus - was able to request a refund from Amazon, have it approved, and UPS scheduled to pick up this defective product and send it back.

Kudos to Amazon for being professional to work with and quick to respond. I am so relieved I bought through Amazon instead of Microsoft.

In (1), the recorded audio quality is terrible. This is not the same as the crisp audio quality I experienced back in Office 2013. And sadly, there is no solution to this problem unless you record your voice with a third party software and later sync the audio with the video.
In (2), the laser pointer is disabled despite tons of people requesting for this feature online. It's just not there, unless you record your video and later insert a pointer using some video editing software.

If you buy from any other supplier, you are taking a chance what you get will be bogus and not usable, and possibly not returnable.

ORIGINAL POST
About the subscription: 5 Stars. You buy the keycard, enter the code in the right spot, and BOOM your Office 365 membership is extended by a year (if you're renewing). Plus, you save about $15 (for the personal version) over what Microsoft charges if you go through them. How do you pass up $15 off???

About Office 365:
First, 1TB of cloud storage for a year is a good value all on its own. Dropbox will set you back $99 for the same thing. Google Drive, $100. There are OneDrive apps for every mobile device, so you can take your files with you. For cloud storage alone, it's a no-brainer. So even if you HATE Microsoft Office, OneDrive is good.
Second, you get the latest version of Office (currently 2016 on PC). Oh, when Microsoft upgrades Office, you get the upgrade too. No extra costs. This isn't just a bunch of web apps you can't use if you're off the grid, either (ie: Google, Apple). You get the full install on your PC or Mac. You also get one tablet and one phone (Android or iOS), and the apps are actually pretty good on those platforms. Oh, you also get the webapps which, IMHO, are better than the Google or Apple counterparts. Same familiar interface as the desktop/laptop applications, which is nice.

If you need more than one license, there is the Home version. It's about $20 off Microsoft's price, and you get five of everything instead of just one.",A no-brainer for cloud storage alone. Office 2016 to boot. $15 off. Where's the downside?,3

Not anymore.

I do recommend installing the inexpensive Ubitmenu UK add-in that brings back the old Office 2003 style menus to Word, Excel, etc. in case you prefer those, but the ribbon on the current iterations of Word and Excel is vastly improved over earlier versions (particularly 2007 and 2010).

Well no. No f-ing way, this is exactly outlook 2010 which was functionally the same as office 2003 in terms of contact management.

I got this one year subscription ""free"" on a new Win 10 laptop and now I really wish I'd just bought the cheaper laptop without it because I'm pretty sure I'm going to delete it and install 2007 from my disc. It's buggy, it crashes repeatedly every time I open a file from anywhere (and I don't have ADDYY or any addons running), NOTHING changes the useless Normal template so every time I go to start a new document I have to set it up from scratch AGAIN and it's not even possible to get it to remember the view I want to open my documents in. Every time I open it it's like it's the first time and it remembers none of my preferences or settings or saves to the Normal file. And again, it crashes CONSTANTLY. I've ""repaired"" it to no avail and if I take it off I'm NOT wasting my time putting it back on. Can you tell I'm frustrated? Don't do this to yourself, it's not worth it. There are free programs out there that I've never liked as much but since this version of Office is utterly defective in my experience so far, this might finally be Google, here I come, I guess. :P

For some reason macros for earlier versions do not work, and if you write a macro that has anything to do with Find/Replace, it will not behave in a similar fashion to earlier versions. This is partly because the people who designed 365 assume users of no particular skill, who are content to use Word just the way it comes out of the box. In other words, Word 365 is more automated, less kindly about those who want to tailor it to do specialized functions. I'm sure that people who are conversant in Visual Basic will have better luck. I am not, and will go back to an earlier version of Word (Everything up to 2010 worked perfectly.)

Again (check below for more), there is little I can discover in Word 365 that warrants a subscription. That you are renting it year by year, from my point of view, is just another Microsoft scam.

I would strongly recommend anyone who has used earlier versions of Office (probably up to 2007 for PC) to stick with the older versions. Although I am still in the free trial period, I find Office 365 Word the most bloated, difficult to use, counterintuitive program of any writing program I have ever used. I think what the designers had in mind was the ultimate ""automated"" program possible--imagine a car with swerve control, automatic parallel parking, object detection, automatic braking. That is what 365 Word is. The ribbon by itself hoards the screen. Though retractable, you will not easily be very productive as you will be spending most of your time searching for the functions that, as far as I know were available in the classic menu in the version previous to 2010. The program is so fully automated that it is human proof. There might be workarounds, but I have as of yet been able to work with its newly designed ""styles"" which they splash across the screen as if, writing were nothing more than prettifying your page. My sense is that the programmers are ""peachy proud"" of all the new features they have built into this mayhem.  You can, of course, after you pay Microsoft for your annual prescription, buy downloadable ""classic menu"" software--that too will cost you, and then, you can buy book, reference books that you can read late into the night.  My question would be why would anyone put money out for a program that is as difficult as learning a new language. And why would a user of  Word all the way back to the '97 version have to dedicated so very much time to relearning what is meant to perform the simple function of writing.
Perhaps you have the time. I'm going back to the 2003 version.

I have since added the classical menu, courtesy of [...] I am still in the 15 day free trial period, but the classical drop-down menu does improve the ease of use of Word 365. The Classical Menu software even has a couple of functions that are not listed in the ribbon menu. I have updated my rating for 365 to two stars. Still a difficult program for us long time users who used to enjoy the transparency of the older versions.

Aug 1. Update. Again, I would warn the user of earlier versions to expect the unexpected. Since I last updated this review, two strange factors  have occurred. First, Word 365 stripped out macros I wrote in my desktop (I followed instructions, went to options/trust/and enabled all macros). It worked on my laptop but not my desktop. Second, for reasons unknown to me, suddenly Word 365 started saving my docx in 365 format and not 93-97. More strange, if you go to your folders from 365, it won't show anything but your 365 formats. This is not true if you go to your microsoft windows view.
Also, I wish to note, that Word, if like me, you have Windows 7 and only 8 gig ram, 365 programs are as slow as molasses in Vermont in the dead of winter.
Adding to its slowness is a splash page inbetween what used to be the relatively simple operation of saving your file. First you have to go to a file screen, then to save or save as or browse, or, etc. The file splash screen is  more aesthetic than functional and again shows the programmers of 365 to be more interested in ""pretty"" over ""efficient.""
I do not think overpriced 365 will last. Libra Office, which I had thought lacked a decent outline format (like Word) now has one, and even an add-on program, Organum.

I am  probably trying the patience of anyone who wants to take in a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. Another defect I discovered in Office Word 365 is that there is no option to create a backup copy of your documents with a ""save."" You can use Options, Advanced to save a backup copy, but it saves your file in the ""Roaming"" folder (if your hard drive goes, your backup goes). Of course, you can use the Cloud, but that too is a separate operation. As with the Classic Menus, you have to buy a special software program if you want to streamline your save procedure.

I cannot remember what it exactly was, so I called the installation support number on the back of the card. An (Indian) technician, very friendly, set up a program to access my computer. After he had worked for some time trying to install Office 365 he informed me that I had some malware (Zeus) on my computer which was the reason that Office 365 could not be installed. He told me that someone else in his company could fix the problem, he would transfer me. The next technician (American?) said he could fix it but this would cost money which I had expected. He offered me a yearly service contract for $150.00 plus $20.00 tax. He tried to talk me into a multi year contract which I refused. When I attempted to pay with my credit card the charge was refused by the bank. The same result with my second credit card. The technician told me I should call my bank ""but not tell them it was for a computer company"". The charge finally was accepted and he started  working on my computer which I could follow, though not understand, on my monitor. After about three hours of activity the first  technician called and told me that everything worked now and Office 365 was installed. So far so good.
Next day I got the invoice from SINGH TECH for $170.00. A few hours later I received an e-mail with a fraud alert from my second credit card that they had denied a suspicious charge of $170.00
I have not received from SINGH TECH any information what was done to remove the virus nor do I know what the service contract entails. I have only received a customer code and a telephone number from the first technician.
My computer, after I upgraded to Win 10, started freezing up occasionally ( about once a day), a nuisance but since it was rare I accepted it. The equipment is some years old, it still works but I cannot get drivers for Win 10 anymore. Now, after the installation of Office 365 and the ""removal of malware""  it freezes up several times a day. I have to do a hard shut-down with the power button and  a start to get it going again. The Office 365, at least what I have used so far, seems to be working ok.
I tried to Google SING TECH (in Baltimore as per their e-mail invoice) which was not so easy to find; what I found were a few web sites asking if the company was ""legit or a fraud"", another one complaining about  having been told he had a virus etc.

I was concerned by the mixed reviews of this product on Amazon, but they were misleading: renewal was super-easy. And with Amazon Prime, I received the product the day I ordered it.

At first, I was a little concerned that I was sent a Product Key for a '1 year subscription for 1 household' 'Spanish and English' 'Office 365 Home Premium'. Before opening the package, I called Microsoft. They confirmed that this was good for the US market and not some product licensed for a different geography.

To renew, I searched for 'Renew Office 365 for Home'. I selected 'Buy another year of Office from a Retail store'. I followed the instructions: I went to the link provided, entered the 25 character code I received. I pressed Next. Surprise! I was done. (The instructions said that I would need to enter the Microsoft account associated with Office 365, but the registration page knew who I was because I was logged into my Microsoft Account on a different window.)

And yes, the subscription was EXTENDED for 1 year, not set to 1 year from the date I went through this procedure. Separately, I read that you can extend for up to five years, if you are so inclined.

I declined the option for auto-renewals, because I paln to follow this same procedure next year when I need to renew. It saved me 20 bucks.",It worked. It was simple. I'll do it again.,4

This allows me to install four instances, and still have a spare.

Only minor complaint, I started with the 30 trail.  I installed three instances to give it a try on Mac and Windows.  Found it worked well, and bought the license key.  When my trial period was up, I entered my 1-year key.  It was accepted, but only a day or two later received an email that I had been charged $9.99 for a one month subscription.  I had to call to get it sorted out, but the support rep was friendly and finally understood the situation.  Once he did, the charge was reversed and the account ""configured"" to coincide with my actual one year subscription.

The only other item, and this is the reason for removing one star:  the Mac and Windows versions are really different; more than expected.

I had Office 2013 installed so was already happy. I was convinced I would get 24/7 support by either phone, chat, or email.  Lie.  Yes, there there is a support line somewhere in the eastern hemisphere.  The people on the other end of the line are trained in two things:  1.  Hanging up on you (it has happened to me three times, then MS sends me a survey asking about my support experience)  2.  Saying, ""...that type of support is outside our support boundary."" ...new term for me: Support Boundary.  The support you get is technical only.  That is, if you have a problem getting one of the programs to install. If you want help using the program, you will get this response, ""Sir, go on the Web and find www.office.com/training. There you will find some garbage that says ""We are creating more modules every day.""  I would give it one star, but the saving grace is the included OneDrive TB of memory.

When the key code arrived, I updated it to my account and then handed the card to my son, assuming that this worked like every other multi-computer key coded software on the planet. It doesn't. My account changed to reflect that my subscription expired and my son's sign-up created a new account. I didn't know about this until MS contacted me to let me know that my service had expired. I followed their instructions and the date simply did not update - no explanation of why or what happened. No error message. The process simply didn't result in an updated expiration date.

So after sorting through MS web pages for 20 minutes to actually get service I could contact, I chatted with online help, who seemed confused themselves, didn't answer my questions and who ended the chat without helping 10 minutes later. How do they expect a customer not to be frustrated by the time they even find access to online chat? Just because they don't know the answers themselves, they could check with someone else rather than ending the chat.

There are other similar office suites available that are both cheaper and similar in functionality. Some even allow files to be saved as MS file types. I bought this product because I'd used it professionally for years. I had no idea the product and especially service degraded to this level. After this experience I don't think I'll ever buy Office again. It's too bad Amazon won't allow this to be returned at this point.

https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Special-offer-for-customers-with-Office-2016-and-Office-2013-standalone-applications-c32e3cad-e935-4163-a44f-50d896e10bbc

Here is the reality.  I spent 80 min on the phone with Office tech support trying have Project and Vision working with Office 2016.  First, they had problem generating the key.  Then transfer me to Sales agent who denied the existing of the free offer and hung up on me.  When I call back, I was transferred again and again between Office Tech support and Windows tech support in Philippine.  They all told me that the only way I can use my Project and Visio again is to downgrade Office back to 2013.  Again, everyone denied the offer posted on MS website.

I was hung up second time when I asked for manager.

Please repost.

Maybe, if all of you repost it enough times, I may be able to get what MS promised on paper.  On the other hand, if you have Office 365 subscription and using Project or Visio, cancel the subscription.",Should be Call SCAM 2016,
4.0,True,"10 29, 2015",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,0763855553,Trenton Bennett,"The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options.

The full review:
More to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.

So what exactly are you getting here?

This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called ""OneDrive"" (formerly known as ""SkyDrive"") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.

It's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.

This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.

Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (""the Cloud"", a.k.a., ""on the Internet"") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the ""Kanban"" look that you also see in Windows 8's ""Metro-now-called-Modern"" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.

My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.

You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose ""Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.

The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.
The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.
The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.

Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or ""bonus feature"" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.",Times have changed,39

I'm a huge fan of the 5 user concept in which you can share this between 5 total users in your household with each person getting their own 1TB OneDrive account and access to Office 365 on multiple devices.  My issue with Office 365 is that the office suite portion is buggy as all hell. After installing on 2 desktops and 3 different laptops Word, Excel, and PowerPoint would all stop responding for no apparent reason on a very regular basis.  So regular that doing any work within Office was impossible. These issues could not be satisfactorily resolved through patching/updates or reinstallation of the Office suite or even starting from a clean install of Windows.  Thankfully, I still had office to my Office 2010 media and after completely removing Office 365 I was able to get each computer back to a stable Office platform.  Hopefully this issue, whatever it is, will be addressed in the upcoming update to 365.

I will say that Office 365 works great on my Macbook Pro and on iOS devices.  Can you feel the irony?","Onedrive portion is great, Office 365 however stops responding regularly.",10

Now I have 7 months subscription left but unable to use the software.

Microsoft promotes people asking community. I did and not unexpectedly it helped nothing. Then I finally figured out a way to chat with a support guy. He collected whole bunch of my information and told me there's an outage at Microsoft server and asked me to wait 24 hours. Now 2 days have passed and issue still not resolved. Today I reached the chat support again, and Francis Philip (display name Francis M) asked me to wait 24-48 hours again. No apologize and no compensation. I told him I'd already asked to wait. He then said, I could contact someone else in India if I wish, because that's Office 365 guy.

I told him I'm going to cancel but never renew again. He then sent me a number for billing straightly, with no more explanation. So basically he was not willing to help me anything and kept giving me numbers to dial.

So basically Microsoft is switching to a business model that keeps charging users monthly but not a one-time cost, then when there's an issue at their side preventing user activating, they'll just keep user waiting, neither providing a workaround to at least allow user use the software for now, nor trying to solve the issue right now, not to mention compensation.

I knocked off a star because of the stupid installation I had to go through:

Enough on that - here is where you will have problems installing this product:
If you were a student at a University/College that gave you a free copy of Office 365 (or Office 2013) Pro edition:
The Pro Edition is a limited use product.  It is tied to your student email account - or in my case it was tied to my personal account and school account (double badness for me).  When you graduate, finish, take a break, etc - your school IT department will cut you off from the use of Office Pro.

You must use either the new web browser with Windows 10 (Edge) or Internet Explorer when you are logging into your Microsoft account and then attempting to establish a new or revised account when replacing your old school authored version of Office 365.  Tor Browser and Firefox will not work correctly.

Tried to establish a new account with the new key - did not work
Tried to remove the school version of Office - did not work
Tried to re-associate my email with a new Office account - did not work

You cannot just change the email associated with your former school account and the Home version.  In my case I had to call up Office.com support and have them remove my personal email account from its association with Office Pro (school account) and then enter my new product key, associate my personal email account with the product key, then force the install of Office 365 Home.  After the install, Office 365 (2013)  Pro (school account software) was removed and a Microsoft tool called 'Fix It Solutions' - which essentially removed all the registry entries and hidden files related to the school account.

If you look under your File + Office Account then your User Account - then Manage Account - you will be taken to a page where you will either login to a Microsoft account or you will be forced to login with your student ID/student email account.  Even with a new product key - and the intention of creating a new account - the Pro (school) software prevented me from downloading and installing a new copy of Office Home - due to registry restrictions and a pushed download associated with the Pro (school) version.  Not sure why my school did this - or if it was unintended or just a stupid IT department requirement.  The Office.com tech support was able to resolve the conflict with no issues - and I was very happy with the prompt attention Microsoft gave.",Great product - beware of tricky install if you are replacing a school account,

The statement that you can ""install on 5 PC/MACs"", is somewhat misleading.  Here's what I have experienced:
I have 2 Macs (a MacPro and a Macbook) which I share with my wife; we both have our individual logins on both of these machines.  I did a single install on each of them, and then each of us logged into the Office apps to activate them.  When I go to the account page, it shows me that 4 installs have been used, not 2 as I would have expected from the licensing description.  So even though I have 2 installs, on 2 machines, used by the same 2 users, I have used 4 installs, instead of the expected 2.

I contacted support via the My Account page, and they've told me that's the way this is supposed to work.  Although somewhat disappointed, I am happy because it does what I need it to do.  Kind of wish the literature would have done a better job at explaining that it's 5 ""logins"", rather than installs.",Not quite 5 installs.,8

I'm not sure what the problem is with other people, but I can tell you that this is an amazing deal! Sure, who really wants to pay X amount of dollars every year for Office, but when you add up all the other bonuses it really becomes pretty obvious that this is a bargain. I know, I don't *OWN* the software anymore but I'm paying $15 per user a year for the software AND the extras so why not?  The 1 TB of OneDrive storage itself is worth it, plus the bonus of always being on the latest version of software so to me it's a no brainer. Your family will love you for it..  Do it!

Also, as far as Macs are concerned the latest version available is Office 2011 so although you'll get the Office 365 Licensing model you won't get the actual latest and greatest version of the software. You can however download the latest Preview (2016) and use that and when that becomes release you'll be upgraded as part of your subscription.

5.0,False,"02 21, 2015",A3B2NVTP78WHUE,0763855553,Jeffrey Rickel,"An incredible product.  Is it worthwhile to get a subscription?  That depends on how up to date you like being and how many machines you have.  The incredible value with Office 365 now is the unlimited cloud storage in OneDrive that comes with it and can be given to up to five unique users.  That alone is worth $100 a year.  You can keep every photo, video, music file, etc on OneDrive and access it on any phone, tablet, or computer with an internet connection.

Yet you also get Office Professional on up to 10 machines (5 PCs/Macs, 5 tablets).  This also means you do not get left behind when a new version of Office hits or when new apps are added to Office.  For instance, Office 2016 is likely to have at least two more new applications in it that may change how productivity is done.  Microsoft Sway is an incredible, intuitive presentation program that is a new take on what Powerpoint does, adding more in some ways while being able to create a multimedia presentation in a simple way.  If you just purchase the current version of Office, you get left out and have to spend more money next year as more and more people begin using the new products.  Office 365 protects you against that.  It also allows for easy activation and deactivation of devices, making Office more portable than ever.

One last feature is the stackability of the subscription.  There are times that you may find Office 365 on sale here or elsewhere.  Maybe an Office 365 card is marked down to $80.  You can buy one or more, add them to your account, and stack years of subscriptions.  Or you can go buy a cheap tablet, get an Office Personal subscription, upgrade it for $20 to Home Premium, and add it to your current subscription.  This means years of Office Professional and years of unlimited OneDrive storage.

This is a great deal at this point with Skype minutes, unlimited cloud storage on the most cross platform cloud service, OneDrive, and Office Professional with all new versions included.",2015's No Brainer,

It felt like MS was trying to shore up into income stream by turning us into subscribers rather than traditional consumers (because they were and are). But if you consider this

365 comes with ALL the office products
365 gives you the very latest version of the office products at all times
365 gives you FIVE separate licenses for 5 computers or devices
365 gives each of your FIVE licensees 1 TB or OneDrive Storage
OneDrive Storage is fully integrated into Windows 8 & Windows 10. It also works on iOS...

These features are neat in and of themselves. I'd also argue it makes 365 a bit of a bargain. Some might argue that owning Office would be cheaper over the long term but I'd have to disagree. 5 licenses covering Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook etc. run about $1000 or so. And eventually you will want to upgrade - some people say you don't have to but as someone who has used Word and Excel since version 1.0...I'd say most full-point version upgrades ARE worth it if you can afford it. And with 365...you've got it.

You can get a personal edition with 1 license for less.

Home editions can be found on sale for around $70 a year sometimes. You can buy 4 of them and take care of ALL MS Office needs and your cloud storage for $280 for 4 years like I did.

I've had a long and sometimes troubled relationship with MS products dating back to the 80s. I think I've tasted the good, the bad, and the super ugly they've produced over the years and am hardly a cheerleader for them.

3.0,False,"12 9, 2014",A9J4UURM4OSDW,0763855553,Michael Sandman,"I've been using Office for years, probably since it first arrived.  I bought 365 because (1) it has an iPad version that allows the creation of documents on a mobile device and (2) that capability is supposedly integrated with OneDrive, the MS cloud storage offering.  So you should be able to create a document on an iPad and store it either on the iPad or on OneDrive, where you get a free terrabyte of storage with your subscription.

Alas, while Word and Excel work very well on a keyboard-equipped iPad, there's a big glitch with OneDrive. Large numbers of users (including me) can't connect iPad Word or Excel directly to our OneDrive accounts.  So you can't create a document on the iPad and save it in your OneDrive account in one step.  If all the threads on the MS Office 365 support page are right, this problem has been unsolved for months, and it's a deal-breaker for many people. There's a work-around: Download the iPad OneDrive app from iTunes and open docs stored in the cloud from there.  While that's OK for documents already created and saved in OneDrive, it's no help for docs you create on your iPad.  You can save them there, but if you want to use the cross-platform capability you paid for and store them in OneDrive, as far as I can tell you have to email them to yourself, open the email on a computer and save the document in the cloud.  That's a stupid workaround, and if anyone who can tell me how to fix this, please adda comment to this review!  And it's very strange, because it's easy to connect to your Dropbox account from the iPad and access your documents, and it's easy to connect to OneDrive from an iPhone!

Apart from the sad problem with Office apps on an iPad not connecting directly to OneDRive, Office 365 works well and the apps for iPad work surprisingly well.  If you want to use Office on a mobile device, subscribe for a month to try it out and see whether the missing link to OneDrive is too much of a pain to bear.

Having said all that, it's only fair to say that the installation process on a computer was surprisingly easy despite the large number of one-star reviews.  When you install Office 365, it doesn't remove previous versions of Office applications (Word 2010, etc.) but it DOES keep all of your settings, including plug-ins for programs such as Dragon Naturally SPeaking.  That was a surprise and a great relief.

The opening screen for Word and the other applications differs earlier versions of Office.  Instead of a blank spreadsheet or document, there's a screen offering to open create a new document. If you click on Open and then Browse you get to the usual Windows Explorer list of folders and files.  There may be an extra mouse click involved, but from reading some of the unfavorable reviews, I think people were thrown by the changed interface.  It's really OK -- it's just different and you have to get used to it.

So... all in all, I'm still very unhappy by the inability thus far to figure out how to connect Word on my iPad to One Drive without a lot of stupid work-arounds, but the new version does integrate OneDrive so that you can access it from multiple computers.  That puts all of your stuff up in the cloud where it's not going to be destroyed by a hard drive crash.  And oddly, I could get to the files in the cloud seamlessly from an iPhone, but not from an iPad.  If I find a way to do that, I'll edit this review.",A promising cross-platform product that doesn't fulfill a key promise,2

Background: I had a Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium trial version installed on my computers, and towards the end of the trial period I needed to decide whether or not to buy it from Microsoft or somewhere else. To purchase the annual subscription from Microsoft, it costs $99.99 for one year or $9.99 per month.  Instead, found the key card on Amazon for $69.99 (for the mailing option, mind you the instant download option is still $99.99).  If you can wait for 6-7 days, just order the PC/Mac Key card.

Since I was purchasing the license from Amazon, to avoid getting billed by Microsoft in the meantime, I deactivated my license from my account on the Microsoft website. After the key card was delivered, all I had to do was login to my Microsoft account and update the subscription key. It accepted it without any issues whatsoever. Also, when I tried to open up MS Word, it asked me for the subscription key and to activate the license which I did. This process works for renewal as well.
Note: If the office software keeps asking you to update the key even after activating the license, just reboot your computer. That solved the problem for me. The entire process took just 10 mins. So go for it!",Way cheaper than buying from Microsoft! Works with an existing installation for renewal/upgrade!,

About one month after purchasing a year's subscription to Office 365, the ""share"" feature stopped working. This means I can't email or provide links to any of the documents I create on my iPad-- which pretty much makes the whole app worthless. Normally, I would have simply contacted a tech support representative and had the problem resolved that next day. That's what I've done with Apple and Amazon. Even smaller online companies I've done business with have a quick and easy chat service that allows them to solve problems quickly. A company's accessibility says as much about its confidence in its product as the performance of the product, itself: if they've got nothing to hide and are truly committed to offering their customers the best possible experience, there's no reason for them NOT to be accessible.

So you can imagine my dismay when I discovered that microsoft tech support is totally and completely inaccessible. After searching the app's ""help"" feature with absolutely no success, after languishing on hold to chat with an online representative that wound up being outsourced and clueless, after digging through the FAQs, forums, and articles to no avail, I came to the sorry conclusion that I could not contact microsoft because it did not want to be found. This is a perfect example of a company that knew it was hawking garbage and, after having flung its refuse in my face, slipped gleefully into the shroud of the inter-web-- never to be seen or heard from again.

In short: Office 365 for iPad is a scam.

I tried to delete and reload the apps with no success. I tried to work directly in word online with no success. I tried saving the documents to the onedrive and directly to the iPad with no success. Copy and pasting what I've written into the body of an email undoes all of the formatting, and is therefore not a viable option. And before microsoft sends one of its cronies to comment on my review: YES. I have absolutely provided the company with a direct comment/feedback on this situation. I provided it nearly two months ago and have seen absolutely no change since.

So, in utter desperation, I've been downloading all of the updates for the office apps as soon as they become available, hoping that one of them would finally solve the ""share"" problem for iPad. But instead of improving the apps, the update has only made them worse. Today's update completely got rid of the ""word count"" feature-- a very basic feature that I rely on to do my job-- and replaced it with some tool that allows me to see the document as a full page instead of the traditional view (... wth?). Now when I search ""word count,"" the help feature swears it doesn't exist, never existed. And I don't have an extra hour to spend trying to communicate with an outsource technician. So today is exactly the day that I decided to stop being nice and write this review.

What we have in microsoft is a company so bloated and monopolized that it no longer cares about the woefully shoddy quality of its products, a company that has sold out to join the scam artist conglomerate of comcast and at&t. It's as if microsoft has a whole separate ""Ways to Piss Off Our Customers Thinktank"" department. I swear it does, because there's no possible way it could be more annoying, inefficient, and downright incompetent.

I know there was a lot of ranting in this review, but the takeaway should be this: if you're wanting to work on your iPad, look elsewhere. The Office 365 apps for iPad are buggy and disappointing, and I have zero confidence in microsoft to fix them anytime this decade.",Worthless for iPad,6

2.0,False,"10 24, 2014",A29BGBRZPMLPZM,0763855553,Book Buyer,"Something went terribly wrong at Microsoft in 2011-2012. Predicting that the entire globe would soon be replacing their desktops with touchscreen devices and monitors, Microsoft began designing its software with those users in mind. The best example, of course, is Windows 8, which welded together the traditional desktop experience with a metro UI that was minimally useful to desktop users focused on mouse-and-keyboard productivity. After a deluge of criticism, much of it deserved, Microsoft backtracked and began releasing updates to the OS that reintroduced features and options more suited to the desktop user (like the ability to boot straight to the desktop). Windows 8.1 was a big step in the right direction for those of us who use our computers for work rather than play, and Windows 10 promises to be an even bigger leap.

The problem is, Office 2013 -- which is the Office version that currently comes with the Office 365 subscription -- has the same problem as the initial Windows 8. Regardless of what the spokespeople at Microsoft will say, this office suite was designed with tablet users in mind. On a tablet, the Office 2013 experience is excellent, even elegantly simple and beautiful. Great new features, like synching office settings across multiple devices and greater integration with the OneDrive cloud (a service that I'm a huge fan of), add value. On a desktop, however, it delivers the equivalent of the experience that the metro interface of Windows 8 did. All of its aesthetic design strengths become weaknesses on a 22 inch non-touch monitor. It just seems clunky, out of place, and half baked.

The first thing professional users will notice is that there is an awful lot of white space in Outlook.  Things just seem bigger. And it's no accident: the scaling of the software was designed with high-dpi screens (like tablets) in mind. When using Outlook on a normal desktop monitor, you end up reading emails where the name of the sender is an unnaturally large font size. The calendar is no longer visible in the main inbox display, instead replaced by more white space and the aforementioned large font (again, something that makes sense on a higher-dpi display). In other words, everything seems out of proportion. Let me rephrase that -- everything IS out of proportion.

What is worse is the rendering of the fonts. Although this is a problem that actually occurs on all of MS's native application programs in Windows 8. X, it is particularly annoying with Word. After all, I can easily install a different web browser to bypass Internet Explorer, but MS Word is a different beast entirely. In geek language, what MS did was opt to use grayscale font aliasing in these programs instead of the RGB font rendering of its older API. The result, once more, is a great experience on a tablet. On a desktop? Fonts seem just a tad blurry or hazy. Basically the result is that Office 2013 on a desktop gives you the same font experience you would have had if you had ever deselected the ClearType option on any sort of LCD panel running Windows in the 2000s.

What to say about this piece of software then? Well, I uninstalled Office 2013 and reinstalled my old Office 2010. The problem with 2013 isn't that it does away with the Aeroglass appearance, which I like but am not particularly committed to. My problem is that it does away with it for all the wrong reasons: to create a better experience for tablet users. Yet the people most likely so sit down and work for extended periods of time with MS productivity software - like Office - are likely to be those NOT working on tablets, but instead working on good ol' fashioned mouse-and-keyboard systems.

MS is fixing its mistakes with Windows 8. It's time they start doing the same with Office 2013, which seems to be fossilizing the mistakes that Windows 8 eliminated over a year ago. Until it does, I am sticking with Office 2010.

EDIT: I wanted to update this to account for the fact that I have tried out Office 2016, and it has the exact same font issue that Office 2013 had. So if you subscribe to MS Office 365, and you have a nice desktop monitor, you'll be experiencing the same antedeluvian font rendering effects. Terrible. Wake up, Microsoft.","Designed for a tablet, not a desktop",8

I paid Microsoft for a 1 month subscription of Office 365 Home Premium, then purchased one of these 1 year subscription cards to extend my subscription for another year. That didn't work out as planned.

I signed up for 1 month of Office 365 on 8/23/2014 with an expiration date of 9/23/2014. I applied this key card on 9/6/2014 and it showed an expiration date of 10/5/2015. What the heck?! Shouldn't it extend my subscription until 10/23/2015??? The short answer is NO.

I contacted Microsoft support and had a very long chat with an agent before discovering that the key card I purchased was for a 1 year free TRIAL of Office 365. I had already purchased a 1 month subscription, and then started a TRIAL that would run concurrently with my paid subscription. The TRIAL does not extend a subscription. I reviewed the listing on Amazon and the packaging of the key card and did not find any indication that what I had purchased was a repacked TRIAL of Office 365, but that's what it is.

This key card probably works fine on its own if you're new to Office, but beware if you're looking to extend a subscription. I'm double paying for 17 days of my subscription and Microsoft wouldn't do me a solid and extend my subscription a couple of weeks.",Buyer Beware!,3

The IDEA of having copies of office on multiple computers and saving your files to one drive is terrific. With that, you don't have to remember which computer has which document. If you are working on something large, like a book, you can work on it at whichever computer is available. This is a tremendous potential benefit.

The current execution of that idea can be a nightmare.

I cannot tell you how many times I have had to sort out which version is my current version, and which version was the previous version.

After using this software for hours at a time most days over 5 months, I still find it difficult to know the correct answer when I open a document and face the dreaded question ""Which do you want to keep? Keep server version, or Keep My version"". Apparently one of those didn't get my changes. Just yesterday I saved a document which appeared to both save and upload correctly. Then this morning I was faced with the dreaded question. As both saving locally appeared to work, as well as uploading, shouldn't they both have my changes? I chose ""Keep my version"", since saving locally seemed more likely to have succeeded. Wrong! All my changes were gone. Ironically, they really had been uploaded, as I could find the changes in the previous version on the onedrive website.

Writing something like a book this sort of issue can be dramatically more painful. What if the last time you touched it (a week ago) you made important but key updates in a few places, but you don't recall what they were anymore? Then you have to download both versions and use compare documents just to avoid accidentally trashing all those changes.",The dreadful question: Keep my version or keep server version,2
