"['Software', 'Education &amp; Reference', 'Languages']",,"['Learn Japanese with the long-awaited sequel to Human Japanese! Like its predecessor, Human Japanese Intermediate is built on the idea that the best way to learn and truly comprehend Japanese is to have it explained by someone who speaks your language. Core concepts are explained in a friendly, down-to-earth tone, with frequent comparisons to similar aspects of English. With humor and warmth, it demystifies and illuminates the real nuts-and-bolts of the language--not just vocabulary and canned phrases like many other products. Explanations come alive with deeply interwoven interactive example sentences so that you can immediately see and hear exactly what you\'re learning. Stay on track with an exciting new U.S. patent-pending feature called INGREDIENTS example sentence breakdowns, which provide an instantaneous lookup of every word in example sentences! That means you\'ll never lose your flow in the middle of an interesting discussion just because you\'ve momentarily forgotten the meaning of a word. Human Japanese Intermediate gets into kanji in a big way, too. At the end of most chapters, a new batch of kanji is introduced, with animations of each character, plus example sentences, illustrations, writing tips, and more. The goal is not to simply throw a bag of characters in your lap, but to carefully explain how everything works. To this end, Human Japanese Intermediate keeps track of which kanji you\'ve learned at what point in the text and automatically adjusts the ""spelling"" of words in example sentences as appropriate to your current knowledge. This approach helps overcome the chicken-and-egg aspect of kanji that can make it so challenging.

Looking at letters in a book does not give you the actual feel of their creation, but when you see the wet ink on each letter as it is created, you can then imitate the correct flow of the letter shape with ease. Your right brain is like a camera, seeing and recording images; thats what makes studying a DVD such a good learning tool. Another advantage of a DVD is that you can control the timing of the lessons by pausing the video to practice particular letters. Stay as long as you wish on any image until you can see it in your mind. You will then be able to write it with ease. \nAside from the best possible learning methods, Jacqueline has provided a packet of ten sheets of technical information, letter forms and calligraphy tips, which you can print for yourself. You will see clearly the advantages and disadvantages of various pen styles such as markers, fountain pens, and steel dip pens. You can then select your favorite, or try all three.  Enjoy expressing yourself using beautiful letters! \nJacqueline has also provided a lettering self-critique so you can assess your own progress.  This video is much more than copying letter forms.    It teaches you important skills about spacing and the proportion of the pen size to the letter height.  Not only will your handwriting improve, but you will appreciate calligraphy as an art form!

With Windows 8 Pro, you can connect and share your files. Windows 8 Pro also adds enhanced features if you need to connect to company networks, access remote files, encrypt sensitive data, and other more advanced tasks. The new Windows 8 start screen is your personalized home for items you use the most and can be customized according to your user preferences. Windows 8 Live tiles provide real-time updates from your Facebook, Twitter, and e-mail accounts. Along with the new Start screen, the lock screen now includes e-mail, calendar, and clock widgets. To access your PC, Microsoft has replaced a standard PIN or password with a swipe gesture; unlock your PC by clicking or swiping preset locations you\'ve selected on the lock screen. New functions also allow you to search for your favorite software programs, open, close, hide, resize, or run multiple apps simultaneously with the swipe of a finger or a swipe of the mouse. Windows has also made changes to make your PC more secure by boosting its existing security features and adding ""SmartScreen,"" which acts to prevent suspicious programs or apps from being installed or running on your machine. Finally, Windows 8 also gives you the ability to ""refresh"" itself to give users a new starting point and a cleaner version of Windows. You can upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 8 Release Preview, Windows 8 Consumer Preview, or Windows Developer Preview, but you might not be able to keep all of your files, software programs, and settings.

Course instructors make sure you understand how Photoshop works, and how you work within Photoshop, correctly. After all, to be a Photoshop Ninja, you must be one with Photoshop.

If you don t have the premium subscription you can t get the files. The lynda.com online library is the best way to cram every ounce of value into your learning experience. Free demos are available for each course offered and they are not just sample clips; they are actual step-by-step lessons on how to perform techniques in Photoshop. Visitors are limited to sampling only the first few video tutorials in a course, but the content is great considering it s free. lynda.com is very easy to navigate thanks to the convenient drop down boxes located at the top of the home page.

A course list appears and lets you choose where you would like to start your Photoshop education. Quality: The quality of lynda.com Photoshop Tutorials is amazing. We encourage you to watch the sample videos available and find out for yourself. Watch a tutorial for Photoshop 6 (quite old), and then watch a tutorial for Photoshop CS4 (brand new). By doing this you will notice just how far lynda.com has come in their video production efforts. Watching the newest CS4 tutorials on your computer is just like watching a DVD in your living room. The picture clarity is beautiful and everything on the screen is easy to read. The video interface is very easy to use and in many cases includes closed captioning. Because the player window doesn t cover the entire screen, it is easy to flip back-and-forth between Photoshop and the video tutorial so you can follow along with the lesson. Every Photoshop Tutorial course offered by lynda.com is well organized and has a detailed outline that includes the amount of time each course should take to complete. Each lesson builds on concepts covered previously and the outcome is clear. One organizational aspect we don t like is how the lessons don t play continuously. When you select a video tutorial to watch, it plays through and stops; even if it is only a 2 minute video.

Gizmos 98 addresses four areas that need improving: file security, image management, desktop accessories, and visual entertainment.', 'Makers of Windows utility software too often seem to have the attitude that if something is useful, it must be boring. Not so the developers at Play Incorporated, whose Gizmos Mega Pak is a grab bag of Windows tools that are both entertaining and functional. <P>The tools, or ""Gizmos,"" in this collection run the gamut from security utilities and multimedia tools to clocks and calendars, with some card games thrown in for good measure. All of the Gizmos share a decidedly nontraditional interface, with lots of metallic surfaces and curved edges. This gives the tools a cool, futuristic look, but I often found that the interfaces were not especially intuitive to use.', 'I had the most fun with the Performer Gizmo. This tool let me assemble collections of image files into a slide show, complete with narration, a musical soundtrack, and any of dozens of special transition effects. The end result was a slick, full-screen presentation that I could save as a self-playing executable file and share with any other Windows user.', ""Gizmos Mega Pak includes tools for the security-conscious. The Shredder can be used to eliminate all traces of a file from your hard drive so it cannot be undeleted. And the Vault encrypts files so they can only be opened if you supply the correct password. I found that both tools were exceptionally easy to use - I just dragged the files I wanted to destroy or encrypt onto the appropriate icon. It's fast, too: On my 300MHz Celeron, I encrypted 15 MB of files, while shredding the unencrypted originals, in about 20 seconds."", ""However, those with serious security needs may need to look elsewhere. The Gizmos manual states that the Vault uses the CAST 5 encryption algorithm, but doesn't provide crucial details such as the length of the encryption key used. Such vagueness should give pause to those who really need to be sure their files are beyond the reach of snoops."", 'Other useful tools include the Picture Explorer, which simplifies browsing through images on your hard disk. I also liked the CD Player (much easier to use, and nicer to look at, than the one that comes with Windows 98) and the collection of multiplayer and solitaire card games.', ""In all, Gizmos Mega Pak is a fun and frequently useful collection of tools for Windows. Is it worth the $49.95 price tag? That probably depends on how excited you get about new tools and unusual interfaces. The Gizmos are fun to look at - but will likely appeal to gadget freaks most of all. -- <i><a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/69436/'>From Winmag&#174</a></i>""]",,Gizmos 98 A Suite of EnhancedACCS/COOL Tools for WIN,[],,Plains Art Museum,[],"25,543 in Software (",[],Software,,</div>,,B00000JKJ9,"{'Shipping Weight:': '1.2 pounds', 'ASIN:': 'B00000JKJ9', 'Item model number:': '52-000', ' Date first listed on Amazon:': 'October 24, 1999', 'Discontinued by manufacturer:': 'Yes'}"

Be forewarned, however, although this is an upgrade of the original product, there aren't many new features besides text-to-speech capabilities and some new clip art and music. When it was first released back in 1991, Kid Pix's design power turned heads. Unfortunately the original drawing program is essentially the same. This version of Kid Pix is a bit like a trusty Model-T when compared to new programs like Flying Colors 2.0 and Disney's Magic Artist Studio which have many more tools and options. The opening menu offers five activities. Most children go directly to the drawing portion of the program to start creating. The other four areas let kids make moving pictures, watch cartoons, make a puppet dance by pressing keys on the keyboard and learn about animation. Kid Pix handily loads onto your hard disk, so no CD is required. You'll find a nice range of paint tools, a vast array of tiny stamps and the ability to erase your picture with a stick of dynamite. You can easily create professional-looking slide shows out of an entire classroom of children's work- great for back-to-school nights. We appreciated the program's ability to switch between Spanish and English. The new text-to-speech feature reads back children's writing and pictures can be imported or exported in BMP (PICT for the Mac), JPG or GIF formats.

Lights have a new falloff mode for throw control, and you can enhance render quality through 48-bit dithering and gamma correction. Although overall rendering speed is still slow compared to that of other 3D programs, the preview window seems snappier than in Bryce 3D. A new animation preview also makes it easier to adjust models and motion paths before doing a full render and exporting a movie.', ""While it offers several new features, Bryce 4 still lacks adequate tools for creating 3D-modeled objects such as an apple or a car. The controls provide enough finesse to manage simple shapes like cones, squares, and other predetermined figures, but if a 3D scene requires a character model or any other complex object, you should build it in a different application and import it into your scene. Depending on your point of view, MetaCreations' nonstandard, hard-to-learn interface either hampers Bryce 4 or puts it on the cutting edge of user interface development."", ""Despite its new features, Bryce 4 just barely qualifies as a full version upgrade.

That means Big Bird and his Sesame Street friends act as LearningBuddies, tailoring the program to your children's changing needs while keeping them entertained and encouraged. (Ages 1-3)"", 'This two-CD set consists of two older Sesame Street titles: Let\'s Make a Word! and Get Set to Learn! The activities introduce children to vocabulary, spelling, sequencing, ordering, memory and problem solving. The software has great graphics and strong kid appeal. In Get Set to Learn!, five carefully structured, multiple-choice style games are hosted by ""America\'s Favorite Game Show Host,"" Guy Smiley. Each game has four levels of play which automatically adjust in challenge, and children are rewarded with fun, animated prizes. If they have trouble, the games get easier and hints are provided by the Sesame Street Characters. The activities are very well designed in the way they ask children to sort, count and classify at progressively more complex levels. In the Kooky Cookie Game, Cookie Monster helps children put cookies of different colors and shapes in a specific sequence (e.g., A-A-B-A-A-B). Dunk or Dare is a game where Oscar helps children count, add and subtract up to 20 items. In Count it Up, Up, Up!, Big Bird asks children to count as many as 40 objects in his tree. The CD\'s flaws include long transitions and no record-keeping. The second CD has children join Guy Smiley in his game show, Let\'s Make A Word. As contestants, kids can choose from six Muppet playmates and four discovery sites (farm, construction, park and restaurant), resulting in 24 possible activities. At each venue, Elmo, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, and others introduce concepts such as beginning letters and sounds, rhyming words and spelling. Rosita even teaches kids a bit of Spanish vocabulary.

Lotus expanded custom fields (now there are 20), added a Day Planner view, and provided synchronization tools for PalmPilots. As you'd expect, there's integration with Lotus Domino and Notes (FastSite, for example, can move the sites it generates to your Domino environment). There are HTML output filters for 1-2-3, Word Pro, and Freelance Graphics.

In addition, you can now add labels and totals to crosstabs, suppress empty rows and columns, and assign highlighter colors based on field value. Parameter fields let you filter values before generating a report.<P>When you export to Excel, Crystal Reports now uses formulas (rather than field values) for subtotals and totals. In addition, the revised formula editor consolidates functions into groups, making functions easier to find. Chart options are grouped into galleries, with simpler option selection.<P>You can now import an existing text-based report into Crystal Reports.

Unfortunately, you must identify-either as fields or as large chunks-all portions of text you want to be ignored.

The math practice is found at a Backyard Fair where children play games to earn Blue dollars. These can be spent at the Prize Tent where the pieces kids purchase gradually turn into toys.

Each activity has multiple challenge levels that automatically increase in difficulty as the child successfully plays the games. Several of these activities are quite innovative. There\'s a Mother May I? game in which kids move Blue across a path by counting ropes. Children cleverly practice their color, shape and counting skills in a fun card game.

Carmen Sandiego is on the loose once more, and Acme Detectives is calling upon players, ages 8 to 14, to use a powerful multimedia database to help stall her latest statewide crime spree in <i>Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?</i>."", ""As with most of the Carmen Sandiego offerings, this game has a simple play structure. One of Carmen's minions steals a national monument--the head of the Oregon Trail, for example, or Delaware's corporate registry--and you, as a detective, must track down the miscreant. This process involves interviewing witnesses until you have worked out the suspect's physical description and decoded the necessary clues required to chase him to his next location. Then, warrant in hand, you make the arrest ... and move on to your next case. In time and with enough successful arrests, you might get a chance to bag Carmen herself!"", 'If this sounds somewhat repetitive, it is. What makes the whole process entertaining, however, is the inclusion of location clues, which focus on American history and geography. If the thief has fled to Florida, a witness in Nevada might say that he has sent his golf clubs ahead to Fort Lauderdale. These witness clues are often witty and playful, and in many cases, they can be misleading if taken at face value. Has a criminal gone to Columbus, Ohio, or is the interviewee actually referring to the famous explorer for whom the city is named? Too many wrong guesses will result in a wild goose chase, which will eventually drain your fuel budget and leave you unable to complete your mission.', ""Other features of this game make it useful as a study tool. The profiles of the various states are interesting and colorful, and players will be delighted to see Carmen's underlings wandering through familiar terrain in their home cities, such as the Pike Place Market in Seattle or the Las Vegas Strip. This deluxe version of the game--which features in-depth essays from Grolier's Children's Press, a multimedia library with keyword search, and more than 200 animated, talking characters--offers an archive of U.

Access also allows you to quickly grab system objects (such as tables, forms and code), and it lets you mount shortcuts to commonly used, user-created objects in your Favorites folder."", ""<b>Building on the basics </b><br />The basics of Access are very much the same as before: It offers multiple tables for storing data, with queries for knitting data together, and forms and reports for publishing them. To create a new database, you can either start from scratch or use one of the built-in wizards to create a database from a template (such as Book Collection or Asset Tracking). These wizards are holdovers from previous Access editions, so they'r e familiar and useful."", ""Access 2000 introduces one significant organizational change. When you create a new database, you have the option of selecting how the data is stored--either as a standard Access database file, or as a Microsoft Access Project. Project files (stored with the ADP extension) work differently than database files. They're not repositories for the information itself, but contain pointers to where the data can be stored. With Access 2000, a project file can store the data in an integrated store in Office, or in a networked version of MS SQL Server 6.5 or 7.0. This allows Access users a fast way to prototype client/server applications. Microsoft has gone on record saying that Access 2000 is going to be refined to allow development of client/server apps transparently. Based on what we saw in the beta, this approach is already off to a promising start."", '<b>New layers and levels of functionality </b><br />Microsoft has made many ch anges to the way you enter and view data in tables. For instance, if you\'ve created tables and designated relationships among them, you can see, graphically, how the data intersects while editing it in table mode. Clicking the ""+"" signs to the left of each record opens up a subtable of records that are related to the one you\'ve selected. The expansion can continue indefinitely. This is a very useful way to make sure that when you edit data manually, you can inspect all related data that needs to be modified.', ""The new data access pages build Dynamic HTML pages containing live, mutable data from an Access database. You can browse and edit this data and restructure it into dynamically created pivot-table layouts. Instead of being locked into the presentation of the data that you're given, you can restructure the view in the browser to meet your needs. Even better, if you've stored the file locally, you can preview: the data in the browser without exp orting it to a server. If you plan to let other users view the data across an HTTP connection, you'll need to make sure that they have Office 2000 and IE 4.1 or higher installed on their desktops."", ""Microsoft patterns the process of building a data access page after the way forms are built in Access. What's interesting is that creating cross-tabulated data doesn't require any programming. For example, the contents grid box on the form changes based on which record is selected. We dragged the Description field from the Field List at the right onto the form. To create the data grid that's linked to it, we opened the Related Tables folder in the Field List and dragged over the Products table. All the proper data links were created automatically. You can also group and nest data access pages, with all the proper connectivity and dependencies maintained and reinforced. These in-browser features are all accomplished with Microsoft's Office Web Components, which req uire that the intended viewers also have Office 2000 and IE 4.1 or higher installed. If you're running Netscape Navigator, for instance, you'll still see the data but you won't be able to manipulate it on the fly, even if you have Office 2000 setup. Access is a serious intranet and Web-enabled business tool and more suitable for this type of work than Lotus Approach, which should appeal more to personal users who need some programmability."", '<b>The right connections</b><br /> Another major and extremely important revision is Access 2000\'s ability to connect directly to Microsoft SQL Server. Traditionally, Access used its own Jet database engine to connect to SQL Server. Now, it can connect directly to a SQL Server machine and perform transactions without any intermediate steps, which is faster and requires less overhead on the client side. Access 2000 also supports the usual wealth of export formats: You can export to other database types and export table s and queries as HTML, Active Server Pages, data access pages or directly to an ODBC-connected database.

You can get additional frames on the eFrames companion Web site (http://www .dgusa.com/eframes) for $9.95 each or $14.95 for a monthly group of 100 (30 days of free access included). With so many frames included, however, it probably isn't worth the extra money to purchase more frames. PhotoFrame can also import frames from Auto F/X Photo/Graphics Edges (http://www.autofx.com), a competing product with a street price of $149."", ""PhotoFrame's intuitive interface is easy to work with, although you may need a peek at the Quick Start Guide to get on the right track.

You can save frame-and-effect combinations as presets - a real timesaver when you're applying the same effects to a number of images."", ""Overall, PhotoFrame delivers what it promises: an easy way to create professional-looking image edges and borders.

It features the latest complete versions of award-winning Symantec products. Also included is a bonus pack of handy file-compression, Web, fax, encryption, and year 2000 utilities.', 'Symantec\'s Norton SystemWorks 2000 has finally become the utility suite we always wanted for Windows 95 and 98. Gone are the different interfaces, conflicting modules, simplistic installation routines, and performance-robbing background monitors that always made us wish for something better. Instead, SystemWorks 2000 properly integrates its core components into a consistent package that covers all the bases and still feels light on its feet. As a result, it earns a spot on the WinList. <P> SystemWorks 2000 (or SW2K, as it is known) combines the latest versions of Norton Utilities, AntiVirus, CleanSweep, CrashGuard, WebServices, (all with version numbers updated to ""2000"") plus a Bonus Pack that includes WinFax Basic Edition, Symantec Visual Page, Zip-It, Norton Secret Stuff, and either the Norton 2000 BIOS test and fix (included with the ""standard"" version of SW2K), or Norton 2000 and Norton Ghost (included with the ""Professional"" version). With both versions, a common launcher starts all of the programs and tools, including those in the Bonus Pack. With the core products, all of the individual tools (such as Norton Utility\'s Disk Doctor) can be launched directly, and the single Options button provides access to one-stop-configuration for everything, a vast improvement. <P> Also dramatically improved is the installation routine, which provides both simplicity for beginners, plus the option to selectively disable specific components within the core tools for power users. Plus, one can initially set SW2K to different ""levels"" of protection. ""Full Time Automatic Protection"" runs all of background monitors possible. ""Manual Protection"" runs only the antivirus software and schedules the execution of diagnostic software for after-hours. A Custom set lets you customize all aspects of the monitoring process. Both power users and beginners will be pleased. <P>Our biggest gripe with previous versions of SystemWorks was that the default ""Full Time Automatic Protection"" setting slowed our systems substantially. This time around, that full load of protection was much less noticeable a drag than before - though we were hard pressed to notice the change, benchmarks only showed a 3.5% drop in speed, and there was no decrease in overall system stability. Thus, this is the first version of SystemWorks where we can wholeheartedly recommend you enable everything. One word of caution: don\'t run disk drive monitors on all your drives. On a single ""C"" drive SystemWorks is fine, but the more partitions you monitor, the greater the drag on performance. <P> We were never aware of how badly earlier versions of CleanSweep and AntiVirus needed an ""interface facelift"" until we started working with these new versions. CleanSweep now looks and feels like a Symantec product (it was formerly a Quarterdeck product), and similar tasks are now grouped together on the same screen. The Restore Wizard now works for both backed up applications and ""cleaned"" files, and the redundant Registry Editor (a great one comes with Norton Utilities) has been removed. CleanSweep now performs its scans faster than earlier versions too. Norton AntiVirus now combines foreground scanning, scheduling, reports, and status messages within the overall SW2K window, so users no longer need to wander through different windows to make sure they are protected. <P> When it comes to new functionality, AntiVirus seems to have received the most updating in the suite. Most notable is its new Email Protection, which works by actually acting as a proxy server between your email programs (such as Outlook or Eudora) and your ISP\'s mail servers, and checking your email messages and attachments for viruses even before they are written to your drive. We expected it to slow our connection down, but we didn\'t notice it. And since most of the latest widely-publicized virus threats involved non-executable file types, AntiVirus now checks all files by default. <P> Symantec added more functionality, speed, and configurability to SW2K, answering nearly all of the reservations we had with the previous version, and kept the price the same, making SystemWorks 2000 an excellent suite at a good price.

"['Software', 'Programming & Web Development', 'Database', 'Filemaker']",,"['If Claris FileMaker doesn\'t quite meet your database needs, you may want to check out this offering from ACI. In the past, 4th Dimension (4D) has been primarily a developer\'s tool, but the company has made it much more accessible to the average user. ACI didn\'t remove any of the powerful development tools; it just made 4D easier to use. The program is even cross-platform, so you can use it on your Mac in your Windows-based office. <P>The 4D database is just one of several products in a suite of database development tools and add-ons. The database alone is within a hundred dollars of FileMaker\'s $199 price tag, and you get a whole lot more for your money. A bundled package called 4D Desktop ($499) includes a compiler and a database object management tool called 4D Insider. Both of these tools are indispensable for 4D programming. <P>It isn\'t hard to set up a simple database in 4D (the included tutorials are clear and useful). The program simplifies the process of automatically generating input forms and report forms, and it offers a range of form styles. After you choose your fields and the kind of information they will hold, you\'re ready to start using your new database. Many people could solve all their database problems without ever writing a line of code. <P>Although previous versions of 4D were not known for their speed, version 6 is quick - not as quick as FileMaker Pro, but close, especially considering the greater data overhead in 4D. <P>The real power of 4D is in the world of development. This version is much more object oriented in nature and a good deal more intuitive. The language is compatible with previous versions but includes many more commands and a vastly improved debugger. <P>One of the most compelling new features of 4D is built-in Web publishing. Any database you create can automatically be translated into and served as HTML on the World Wide Web. The application becomes the Web server; all you have to do is run it on a Mac with a TCP/IP connection to the Internet and you\'re in business. The server allows up to five simultaneous connections, which is more than adequate for personal use. If you want to scale up to business use of 4D, there are upgrades that allow for unlimited connections. <P>The built-in HTML for the forms and navigation aren\'t the prettiest, but you could write your own HTML instead. When 4D\'s Web features are turned on, it works just like a regular Web server as well, allowing you to serve regular files from any directory on your computer. You even can have an HTML link trigger a 4D procedure, in effect giving you the ability to perform superfast CGIs without the need for a ""glue"" program. (A glue program acts as an intermediary between a Web server and database that cannot communicate directly, which can cause a decrease in performance.) <P>ACI 4th Dimension has come a long way since version 3. The combination of a competitive price, improved user interface, extended programming capabilities, and automatic Web publishing puts this relational database system in a class of its own. - Wade Albright <P> <B>Good News:</B> Fully relational, powerful development tools.

There was no way to do this with an outbound message in previous versions. The 4.2 program also offers new spell-checking features.<P>Other usability features include an improved message-searching facility. You can search one folder, all folders or user-specified sets, employing up to five search criteria at once. In addition, text-to-speech technology enables the program to speak either the name of the sender or the subject for senders you specify.

Further, Mathcad\'s unique ""live"" interfaces automatically and immediately updates your results with minimal recalculation work. Mathcad makes it even more convenient, with easy-to-use equation entry and editing that uses standard mathematical notation (instead of command-line programming), plus automatic unit conversion. Mathcad also enables you to create accurate technical documents that adhere to internal and external business standards and that can be easily shared, communicated, integrated, and reused.<P> Mathcad 2000 Professional is the industry-standard calculation software package for technical professionals. Mathcad 2000 Professional provides an unmatched level of functionality and features that enable users to solve a broad range of technical problems. Because Mathcad has a familiar ""scratchpad"" interface and understands real math notation, it is easy to learn. By integrating text, equations, and graphics, it also simplifies and streamlines documentation of the design engineering process, which is critical for internal communication and for meeting internal and external business standards such as ISO 9000.<P> Designed to complement the Microsoft Office application suite, Mathcad 2000 Professional has become a standard design platform for technical and engineering design teams within the corporate environment. Mathcad 2000 Professional addresses the workgroup needs of engineers and scientists working on complex technical projects and lets them communicate and publish on the Internet or an intranet. Mathcad 2000 Professional enables users to share resources, integrate project components, and streamline work, insuring accuracy and increasing the productivity of the scientific and design engineering workplace.', 'When I was a struggling physics graduate student, I would have given anything to have Mathcad. Long able to perform anything from the simplest arithmetic to the most demanding symbolic solutions of indefinite integrals or ordinary differential equations, the new Mathcad 2000 Professional version improves its publishing and graphing capabilities, enables project-level problem analysis, and reaches out to new audiences.<P>Mathcad lets you create text, mathematics, and technical drawings on the same worksheet. Mathcad\'s worksheet interface has always allowed you to simply type mathematics on a blank page and let Mathcad grind out simple answers, tables, or graphs. But it is clearly moving beyond that very capable scratchpad to support complete technical publication. In the past, you might do your calculations in Mathcad, then copy everything to a scientific word processor. That is no longer necessary. Mathcad itself now has real mathematical notation, text formatting, font choice, and alignment capabilities to produce output suitable for journal publication. You can even use pre-formatted templates to create output on your company\'s own forms. Since Mathcad has always allowed you to create graphs embedded within the worksheet itself, including graphs within your output is a snap. Anyone who has to prepare technical reports will find this very attractive.<P>Speaking of graphing, Mathcad now includes the highly-regarded Axum LE graphing program as a component. Axum allows extensive control over the appearance of graphs and charts. It also contains its own data analysis tools for curve-fitting, for example. This is a nice bonus, as I have sometimes found Mathcad\'s own graphs to be a little stubborn about doing what I want.<P>One new feature I found astonishing is the MathConnex project manager. Very often a technical problem has a solution that won\'t fit on one page, like the parts of a machine or a complex process. MathConnex lets you link together many Mathcad worksheets and other components, so that the result of one part feeds into another. This allows you to simulate the behavior of very complicated systems constructed of independent pieces. Presumably, different people could work on separate parts, and all the different parts would contribute to the whole system solution. <P>Mathcad is clearly making an effort to reach out to other audiences. Although I didn\'t try this, new connectivity to AutoCAD beefs up the ""CAD"" part of Mathcad. The program itself includes Intergraph\'s SmartSketch LE 2D CAD application as a component. You can also create ordinary MS Excel spreadsheets that incorporate Mathcad capabilities, while Mathcad can get inputs from Excel spreadsheets. In addition, a whole section on financial calculations will appeal to business users, as well as scientists paying off a mortgage. <P>One item I especially liked was Trace Error. You know how it is: you divide by zero somewhere, and everything that depends on that result goes blooey. With Trace Error, you can click on any problematic result and track that error back to its origin. It even gives you suggestions about what went wrong and how to fix it.

"['Software', 'Design & Illustration', 'Illustration']",,"[""In its sixth iteration, Canvas is a mature standalone graphics application that skillfully integrates its separate components, including raster-image editing, vector illustration, text layout, Web graphics production and a huge clip-art library. Competing products, such as Micrografx Graphics Suite, aren't nearly as adept when it comes to integrating and coordinating their separate components. The basic difference is that Canvas 6 has all commands available at all times, while similar programs require you to switch modes-such as activating paint or pixel graphics when in vector-graphics mode, for example.<P><b>Getting started</b><br>I found Canvas 6 easy to install, but it was a bit difficult to get started working with it. At first, I found it frustrating to use Canvas, as I discovered that even simple features, such as selection tools, have a wide range of options depending on whether you're working with vector graphics, raster graphics or text. Eventually I got used to the slightly odd interface; it took me an hour or two to get to work.<P>However, you may not get used to some of the program's performance limitations. While Canvas is a superb illustration program, a good image editor and a good text layout program, it doesn't always perform more advanced functions in some areas. For example, you can link a graphic object to a text phrase so that the graphic in the document is automatically updated whenever the linked graphic is changed. However, you can't link numbered sections or chapters so that they're automatically renumbered if one is deleted. This function is available in full-power desktop publishing programs, such as Adobe's PageMaker and Quark's QuarkXPress.<P>Still, Canvas is very flexible in other ways. For instance, it imports and exports a wide range of graphics formats, including unusual formats such as Adobe PDF and AutoCAD DXF.<P>The net result is that Canvas has a steep learning curve, but is able to perform 90% of what anyone would want, all within one program. Deneba is doing its best to alleviate the difficulty of getting started by including an introductory video with the program.<P><b>Tools to toy with</b><br>The best new feature in Canvas 6 is its SpriteLayer technology. This allows you to apply a different object type or group as a mask and transparency map for other objects-text, vector graphics or raster graphics. For example, you could apply a transparency map on a mask for the casing of a PC, so that the edges of the casing appear solid but the middle is transparent, revealing an underlying layer that shows the PC's insides-its motherboard, hard drive and so on. In the screenshot above, we've applied a transparency map to reveal the veins underneath the hand's skin.<P>The new transparency effects made possible by SpriteLayer include a full range of opacity levels and transfer modes, such as multiply or lighten. Transparencies can also have a gradient, and any other objects, including photos, can be used as transparency masks. You can apply these effects across layers and with all the varying data types, allowing a bitmap of the outside of the PC to be used as a mask on the case sidewalls to make them partially translucent.<P>Canvas also has a new guide layer to help you align objects, and it has added fillets to its CAD repertoire to make precise round corners. In addition, the program provides more feedback about every object and even provides numerical edit fields for quick calculations.<P>One of the neatest new tools is the knife, which slices through illustration layers. You can also flow text along multiple paths, use multiple master pages in a publication, spell check and use AutoCorrect for typing. And you can save pages to Deneba's Colada tool for direct viewing on the Web using a Java applet.<P>Finally, Canvas has improved its performance, with redraws occurring up to 30% faster than in the previous version we tested.<P><b>A new contender</b><br>All of these improvements-superior feature integration and a strengthened feature set-build a strong case for adding Canvas 6 to our WinList. In addition, $375 for an illustration program, desktop publisher, image editor and graphic design tool is a bargain. Canvas 6's price and its range of tools combine to earn it a place on our WinList. -- <i><a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/69436/'>From Winmag&#174</a></i><br /><br />You want it all. You want it now. You want it for less than $400. Adobe may laugh in your face as it charges you that much money for each of its separate graphics applications, but Adobe doesn't count among its users the person who needs an array of imaging tools and doesn't have a ton of money to spend on them. That's the intermediate-level market Deneba wants to reach with version 6 of Canvas."", ""With its improved illustration, photo editing, and page layout capabilities and its powerful new transparency features, this all-in-one solution may even win over some graphics professionals. The biggest coup in Canvas 6 is its set of advanced transparency tools, which utilize Deneba's much-hyped SpriteLayer technology. The hype is well deserved. Other graphics applications, such as Adobe Illustrator 8.0 and Macromedia FreeHand 8, can only perform basic fades and transparencies or require costly plug-ins to perform high-end transparencies."", ""Canvas 6 features a variety of transparencies that can significantly bump up the oh-la-la quotient of your images. The program allows you to apply directional, radial, rectangular, and elliptical vector transparency masks to any objectand these masks are fairly easy to use. Just select the image, choose one of the tools from the Vector Transparency palette, and drag the tool near or over the selected object. A vector line with handles appears, representing the position of the transparency. Drag a handle to place the transparency vector. If you don't get the look you want, select another tool and try again (Canvas negates the earlier vector transparency mask when you apply a new one). You can also add vector transparency masks using a second object. Just place the object you want to use as a mask in front of the object you want to mask, select both objects, and choose Attach Mask in the Transparency submenu of the Object menu."", ""Canvas 6 applies transparency based on the lightness and darkness of the masking object. The darker the image, the more transparency it creates in the masked image. For example, solid black images used as masks will make masked object invisible, while solid white transparencies will have no noticeable effect. Canvas 6 also has pixel-based channel transparency masks that you can paint onto an object using the painting tools. These masks will particularly appeal to technical illustrators who want to create detailed cutaway views revealing what lies beneath an object's surface. For example, think of layered tissue and bone illustrations from publications such as Gray's Anatomy, renderings of buildings with the underlying structure exposed, and drawings of cars with the engine and other parts showing through transparencies in the body. Getting used to the subtleties of transparency masks takes some practice, but once you've mastered them you can give your images a realistic depth that makes them jump right off the page."", ""Folks who want to save their Canvas documents in Adobe Illustrator format should be aware that Canvas images that have transparencies in them won't translate well. When we saved a large Canvas image packed with transparency masks in Illustrator format, for example, Illustrator 6 didn't even recognize it, and while Illustrator 7 opened it, all of the transparencies were gone and the layers had merged. Of course, it's not Deneba's fault that its competition can't do transparencies, but graphics professionals should plan on saving Canvas documents with transparencies as TIFFs if they want to open them in Illustrator. Deneba says it will release a fix to the layer problem in the next service release."", 'While technical draftspersons may scoff at using anything less than a professional-level CAD application, Canvas 6 offers all the tools you need to make floor-plan mockups, blueprints, and models. For example, you can quickly draw primitive shapes such as circles and arcs by defining the radius or three points, as well as perfect polygons using the Multigon tool, and polygons of any shape using the Polygon tool. Add the ability to duplicate, scale, and rotate objects, and you can create impressive designs in just a few quick steps.', ""If you crave down-to-the-millimeter perfection, Canvas 6 has a Dimensioning palette with 17 tools for defining, scaling, and setting measurements and coordinates numerically. Mouse feature is a great help in precision drawingthout intimidating beginner and intermediate users. The program offers many features, such as multiple page layers, that QuarkXPress can't handle without Extensis's QX-Tools 4 plug-in. But the most compelling reason to consider Canvas 6 for your page layout needs is that you can seamlessly add unique graphics you9ve made in Canvas to your pages, making gradients applied to text or objects immediately available in your master pages and style sheets."", ""Working with documents and multiple layers is a complicated task, but Canvas 6's contextual tool tips guide you through unfamiliar tools. We were able to create a mock newsletter in less than 15 minutes. Advanced users will want to explore shared layers across multiple-page documents and use the selective printing options for layers and individual graphic elements, which again is something QuarkXPress can't do without the QX-Tools 4 plug-in."", ""Canvas 6.0's presentation capabilities are very similar to those of Microsoft PowerPoint and Kai's Power Show, with the advantage of always editable objects in your document. Provided templates help beginners put together a presentation quickly. You can even import QuickTime movies into your document and play back a short video clip or musical snippet for clients, which can add flair to your pitch. We found Canvas 6.0's presentation features generally useful and fairly intuitive, as all types of documents share Canvas's tool set."", 'Our only rough spot during the presentation creation process occurred when saving the presentation as a QuickTime movie: because the presentation document was twelve slides long, even the 266MHz Power Mac G3 we were using spun its wheels for almost seven minutes before cranking out the final movie. However, the movie played back fine. Before saving a QuickTime presentation destined for cross-platform viewing, users will want to enable the playback option for PCs.', ""The press can't stop yammering about how the Web is the medium of the future. Well, someone at Deneba was obviously listening, because Canvas 6 now offers Web design tools, located in its Colada palette, that enable you to take Canvas documents and convert them to Web-ready format. Don't throw away your copy of Macromedia's Dreamweaver or Adobe PageMill, though, because Colada's abilities are limited. While it can save a Canvas document in Web-ready format, it requires you to save it as Java only, as a JPEG image with links, as a GIF image with links, or as Java with JPEG or Java with GIF. The Java with JPEG and Java with GIF combination options create two versions of the Web page: a Java version that will display the page as Java in browsers that support Java, and a GIF or JPEG version that will display in browsers that don't support Java. This method presents problems for viewers of that Web page. Any HTML page comprised of one large image, even if it's a GIF file, takes a long time to download on all but the fastest connections. (If it's a JPEG, you can forget about it.) Plus, Java itself is still notoriously buggy and often crashes even those browsers that supposedly support it."", ""In our tests, the Java version of the page sometimes took even longer to load in Netscape Navigator 4.5 and Internet Explorer 4.01 than the JPEG or GIF version of the page did. While Colada is probably best suited for viewing images locally, where connection speeds don't matter, it does offer useful tools you can use in conjunction with your HTML-authoring application to churn out killer Web sites. For example, you can employ it to make rollover buttons, animations, and sounds. Canvas 6 sports a Mac-friendly interface, with a couple of improvements over version 5 that make navigating and selecting tools simple. For example, all of those palettes and tear-offs can take up major real estate on even the largest monitors. To solve this problem, Deneba added a unique Docking Bar to Canvas 6 that can store palettes as tabs. Just click a tab, and the palette drops down like a pull-down menu."", ""One aspect of the interface options that annoyed us, however, was the WYSIWYG font viewing. If you have a lot of fontsisplay. Turn off this aggravating viewing feature if you want speed. Canvas 5's unstable performance made it an iffy proposition. Deneba has fixed this problem in Canvas 6. It's very stable on most machines, although we don't recommend running it on anything slower than a 300MHz Power Mac 6500 603e."", ""For rendering and other memory-taxing chores, be sure to bump up Canvas's minimum memory to the recommended 32MB, or you may suffer through long waits, low-memory warnings, and possibly even freezes. If you9re a graphics professional, you'll probably insist on sticking with your treasured industry standardsyou9re looking to buy your first graphics package, or if you need a whole range of imaging capabilities and don't want to blow away your bank account to get it, you should consider Canvas 6. - <i>Jennifer Ho</i> and <i>Jeff Titterton</i>"", '<B>Good News:</B> Comprehensive, well-integrated drawing, painting, page layout, presentation, and Web tools in one easy-to-use package.

"['Software', 'Programming & Web Development', 'Database', 'Filemaker']",,"[""The last version of FileMaker Pro was a bit of a disappointment for longtime fans of this lovably approachable database - it seemed as if all the developers' energy had gone into the (admittedly clever) Web publishing features, while the rest of the program was more or less ignored. Version 5.0, thankfully, is a far more comprehensive update that makes useful improvements to every one of FileMaker's features. For first-time users, it remains a delightful tool that we recommend without reservation. But this time, owners of previous versions also have reason to celebrate. The first thing you'll notice about FileMaker Pro is that the application's interface has been remodeled to make it more comprehensible to new users. We can take or leave the Microsoft Office-style toolbar, but the menu reorganization is long overdue - what was Delete Record doing in the Mode menu all those years, anyway? Throw in resizeable dialog boxes, improved contextual menus, and support for Apple's newfangled Navigation Services' open-and-save dialogs, and you have the model of a well-designed Mac application."", 'Another bonus for users is an ingenious Layout/Report Assistant. Rather than cramming data into pre-fab templates, this handy step-by-step assistant walks you through the complex process of building grouped reports with fancy headers, footers, and summary fields - a tricky task even for experienced FileMaker users. You can select from a number of layout themes - combinations of colors, fonts, and graphic elements that lend a consistent style to your database. Themes are also used by the improved, style-savvy Web Companion, so your layouts keep their look and feel in a Web browser.', ""Database authors will also welcome FileMaker Pro's new value list options. You can reuse value lists from other databases, and do some very cool stuff using value lists based on database fields. But heads up - older FileMaker databases will need updating to the new file format. In other layout news, you can apply crude engraving, embossing and drop shadow effects to fields. There's also a View As Table option, which displays your layout in a multicolumn spreadsheet format; it's not very pretty, but it's a lot less hassle than creating a columnar layout on the spur of the moment."", ""Rounding out the list of improvements are a slew of other long-awaited tweaks, including the ability to import scripts from other databases and a Web-safe color palette. There's even a primitive data-updating feature you can use to synchronize databases, though it's complicated and poses a high risk of inadvertently mangling data. We hope this will be further streamlined in future releases."", ""There's only one cloud on the horizon. As of version 5.0, the FileMaker product line is splitting into four separate products - this is the cheapest and the first to arrive. As the low end of the database line, the basic Pro now has a ten-user limit for both network and Web access - and to prove it's serious, FileMaker Inc.'s license prohibits the use of CGIs and Web gateways like Blue World's Lasso that could be used to circumvent this restriction. If you need to serve more than 10 users, you'll have to hold out for the $999 FileMaker Pro Unlimited, due later this year. For small-time databasers, however, FileMaker Pro 5.0 is a solid revision that further boosts the program's already superb flexibility and ease of use. -- <i>Mark Simmons</i>"", '<B>Good News:</B> Really useful layout assistant. Web-published databases look a lot better. New value list options are boss.', '<B>Bad News:</B> Data updating feature needs work. Ten-user access limit.', '&copy;1999 MacAddict -- <i><a href=""https://secure.imaginemedia.com/group/maca/8VPX.html"">From MacAddict -- Subscribe now!</a></i><br /><br />The FileMaker database program\'s best and worst feature has always been the confinement of its appeal to its existing user base. Over time, especially through revision 4 (and now revision 5) of the product, the FileMaker crew has tried to broaden its appeal. FileMaker Pro 5 does indeed sport a host of new features, some of them excellent, but whether they will broaden its appeal with, say, existing Access or Approach users is questionable.<P>Perhaps the oddest change is the addition of many Microsoft Office compatibility and interoperability features. The FileMaker Pro interface - specifically, the toolbars - have been redesigned to look more like the Office 2000 interface. This makes it easier for existing Office users to make sense of the sometimes-quirky FileMaker Pro interface, but the old Rolodex-and-drag-bar FileMaker interface is still present on the left side of the window. The revamped interface, on the whole, makes the program more consistent with newer Windows apps - but as far as making it easier to use, that\'s something that only new users already familiar with MS Office, not existing FileMaker mavens, will probably find benefit in.<P>New to FileMaker is the use of a grid view for data, but it\'s not without it\'s quirks. Another Office-like feature that\'s only just been added in this release is the ability to view data in a simple table format -- but it\'s riddled with peculiarities. There\'s no dedicated data-entry mode, so you\'re forced to hit New Record every time you want to enter data. In another irritating quirk that seems taken from the Macintosh edition of the product, the Enter key on the alphabetic portion of your keyboard and the Enter key on the numeric keypad don\'t behave the same way: The Enter key on the numeric keypad returns adds a hard return inside a data field;the other Enter actually records the data.<P>FileMaker\'s most highly touted feature is its built-in web-publishing function. When activated, it runs as a miniature web server, and provides an elegant form-based interface to any set of data you provide. There is a hard-coded limit of 10 unique IP addresses in this edition of FileMaker for Web-browser users; if you want to share databases out to more than ten Web browsers, you\'ll need one of the more upscale editions of the product, like FileMaker Pro 5 Unlimited. If you don\'t want to use the server version of the web publisher, you can always publish tables and layouts directly to static HTML pages, which can be formatted to resemble as closely as possible the way you had your data represented.<P>FileMaker\'s built-in web server for sharing data in a browser lets you choose from a number of different looks for your data. <P>FileMaker\'s biggest problem, historically, was its nonexistent to weak support for relational databases. FileMaker Pro 5 lets you take any database and define relationships between it and any other database with a fair amount of ease. Another smart addition is ODBC support, a long-missing feature that makes FileMaker Pro that much more relevant to PC users (since FileMaker continues to be dominant on the Mac platform, where it was created). Both FileMaker and the needed table have to be open for ODBC to work. <P>FileMaker Pro 5 has a lot of good features inside, but users of database packages that already offer similar functionality will probably be less interested than new users. -- <i><a href=\'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/69436/\'>From Winmag&#174</a></i>']",,FileMaker Pro 5.0 Upgrade,[],,Filemaker Inc.,[],"26,369 in Software (",[],Software,,</div>,,B00002S7OS,"{'Shipping Weight:': '1.7 pounds', 'ASIN:': 'B00002S7OS', 'Item model number:': '322002U', ' Date first listed on Amazon:': 'May 10, 2002', 'Discontinued by manufacturer:': 'Yes'}"

It lets you rapidly build interactive applications that include presentations, Web-based applications and computer-based training. The program also comes with a CD full of sample applications.<P>It's easy to create an application in Multimedia Fusion. To design a presentation, you set up the basic background, add objects (such as text images and sounds) and set properties for each object. Other highlights include ODBC connectivity and the ability to create Web-enabled applications. You can also employ these capabilities to build live interactive e-commerce catalogs and storefronts.<P>I did find using the built-in image editor rather cumbersome, since it isn't as flexible as a full-blown image editor.

The Magic School Bus once again takes off, this time to seven distinct habitats: African savanna, Arctic tundra and ocean, Brazilian rain forest, Himalayan mountains, North America Sonoran desert, North American swamp and South Pacific island and reef. As kids visit each locale in search of the misplaced animals, they learn why animals live where they do and what they need to survive. While exploring, children will find 30 games and activities, ranging from fun arcade-style pursuits to more academic challenges. For example, one game popular with testers was Penguins on Ice in which players must guide penguins across a moving maze-like ice flow. In more educational activities, kids classify animals, assemble animal skeletons and learn about animal sounds and tracks. There\'s also an art area where children can design and print out ecology posters using the animal stamps they\'ve earned by visiting the various habitats. Yet another opportunity for learning is available via eight multimedia reports on amphibians, mammals, endangered species and so on. Finally, when you\'ve found the four lost animals and returned them to their respective homes, you can start the adventure all over again, with all new animals to find. Testers really enjoyed playing the game and thought this Magic School Bus Title was more jam-packed with things to do than its predecessors. It\'s one of the easier titles to play in the series (we had four- and five-year-old children playing successfully) so it\'s probably best suited for the younger end of its recommended age range of six to ten. The program will work well in both home and school settings and makes a nice gift, too, since it\'s just as much fun as it is educational. <br><b>Teaches: </b>science, geography, animals <br><b>Age Range: </b>6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Copyright &#169; 2000 Children\'s Software Revue -- <i><a href=https://secure.tradenet.net/childrenssoftware/csroffer.html>From Children\'s Software Revue&#174; -- ""Subscribe Now!""</a></i>']",,Magic School Bus Explores The World Of Animals,[],,Microsoft,['Explore animal habitats around the world.'],"15,787 in Software (",['B00006H34R'],Software,,</div>,$34.52,B00002S97B,"{'Shipping Weight:': '1.8 ounces', 'ASIN:': 'B00002S97B', ' Date first listed on Amazon:': 'April 3, 2001'}"

"['Software', 'Education & Reference', 'Languages']",,"['It is a credit to Fairfield Language Technologies that its Spanish Explorer is one of the best examples of language-learning software--period. If you are used to the old-fashioned but lamentably persistent grammar-translation method of learning languages, Spanish Explorer may surprise you because it involves no overt instruction in grammar or lists of vocabulary with English translations. Instead, it relies on very clever contextualization of Spanish words and structures with photographs so that you never realize you\'re learning grammar. We literally found ourselves speaking and understanding quite a bit of basic Spanish in about an hour.<P> Each graduated lesson works like this: First, you learn a new word by seeing a picture of, say, a dog. You then read the Spanish word for ""dog"" and hear it spoken: <I>perro</I>. After learning a whole set of words this way, you move into self-quizzing mode, where you see just a picture of a boy and have to choose the right word, either from spoken or written cues. This emphasis on listening comprehension is fantastic and is one of the components that sets the software apart, but there are also reading and writing exercises.<P> So how <I>do</I> they cover grammar? Eventually, for instance, you\'ll see <I>perro</I> under a picture of one dog and <I>perros</I> under a picture of two dogs. If you are a grammar guru, you might be able to figure out that certain singular nouns end in <I>o</I>; plural nouns end in <I>os</I>. However, the beauty is you don\'t have to be a grammar guru at all because the software doesn\'t expect you to state rules like that; it expects you only to associate a picture of more than one dog with <I>perros</I> instead of <I>perro</I>. Eventually, you get into longer phrases that cover verbs, adjectives, and prepositional phrases. It\'s amazingly effortless, especially so for children as young as 6.<P> Caveats: The CD-ROM includes both Mac OS and Windows versions. Your installation will include the first-level lessons of a couple dozen other languages for free, too, so you have to know that the Spanish word for ""Spanish"" is <I>Espa&ntilde;ol</I> in order to select it from the list.

When they locate the requested creature or element, they can ""clone"" it with a special device and then bring it back to the classroom. When four creatures have been found, the classroom itself is magically transformed into a rain forest. The program has many strengths. The graphics are rich, and the format encourages exploration of the plentiful ecological content. Children encounter interesting stories and multimedia reports, and as they travel, snapshots are automatically entered into their journal (which they can write in as well). To help them learn more about the Understory, Treefall Gap and Canopy of the rain forest, children are given a set of investigative tools. There\'s a microphone, for instance, for listening to different sounds that animals make and a telescope that allows them to see what\'s happening in the distance. On the downside, many of the 14 games that children find embedded in the program are little more than arcade-style pursuits. While children weren\'t bothered by this, some adults felt that these activities could have had more learning value. One game, for example, has children using the arrow keys to move a beetle around to catch flowers and avoid rain. A more educationally sound game is the Habitat Build activity that asks kids to experiment with temperature and rainfall to create various habitats. On the whole, our testers loved the program.

If your kids have the patience to listen, however, they\'ll eventually discover many three-level activities. At the Pond, children will love helping the baby ducks find their mother. They\'ll also enjoy shooing crows in the hay maze and throwing a ball for Alex\' dog Oscar.<P>While children and adults will both appreciate the wonderfully rendered farm and the realism of the engaging characters, they may find themselves stumped by some activities. We had trouble finding a way out of the pond, for instance. We were glad to see direct access to the farm\'s locations in the Big Farming Book, but we couldn\'t always find all of the activities on each page.<P>Even with its flaws, the program\'s sheer number of activities-25- plus the high quality graphics and the low price tag make it worth considering.
